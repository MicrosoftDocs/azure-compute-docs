# Report Impact (Preview)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Impact Reporting is currently in Preview. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

You can call our REST API to file an impact report, or use a [connector](./azure-monitor-connector.md) to automatically report impact from Azure Monitor Alerts.

> [!TIP]
> Since most workloads have monitoring in place to detect failures, we recommend creating an integration through a logic app or Azure Function to file an impact report when your monitoring identifies a problem that you think is caused by the infrastructure.
>

## Report Impact via Azure REST API

Review our full [REST API reference](https://aka.ms/ImpactRP/APIDocs) for more examples.

```json

  "properties": {
    "impactedResourceId": "/subscriptions/<Subscription_id>/resourcegroups/<rg_name>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<vm_name>",
    "startDateTime": "2022-11-03T04:03:46.6517821Z",
    "endDateTime": null, //or a valid timestamp if present
    "impactCategory": "Resource.Availability", //valid impact category needed
    "workload": { "name": "webapp/scenario1" }
