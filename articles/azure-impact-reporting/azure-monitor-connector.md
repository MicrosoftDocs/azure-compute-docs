> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Impact Reporting is currently in preview. For legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

When you use the impact connector for Azure Monitor alerts, you can seamlessly report impact from an alert into Microsoft AI operations for change event correlation.

## How connectors work

When you create a connector, it gets associated with a subscription. When alerts whose target resources reside in the specified subscription get fired, an impact report is created through Azure Impact Reporting and sent to Microsoft intelligence systems.
