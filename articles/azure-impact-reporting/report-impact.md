# Report an impact (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Impact Reporting is currently in preview. For legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

You can use the Azure Service Health **Report an issue** pane and the REST API to report an issue. You can also use an Azure Monitor [connector](./azure-monitor-connector.md) to report an impact automatically when certain alerts get triggered.

## Report workload impact

Use the following channels to report a workload:

* Azure Service Health portal pane
* REST API

### [Azure Service Health](#tab/ash/)

To report an issue, follow these steps:

1. Select **Report an issue**.

1. Select **Single resource**.

1. Fill out the required fields:

    - **Subscription**
    - **Impacted resource**
    - **What is the business impact?**
    - **Impact start time**
    - **Impact end time**

1. Select **Submit**.

When your issue is reported, you should see this message.

If an outage is found, you see it in the portal.

If you get the following error, you don't have permission.

### [REST API](#tab/api/)

> [!TIP]
> Most workloads have monitoring in place to detect failures. When your monitoring identifies a problem that you think the platform caused, create an integration through a logic app or use Azure Function to file an impact report.
>
For more examples, review the full [REST API reference](https://aka.ms/ImpactRP/APIDocs).

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "impactedResourceId": "/subscriptions/<Subscription_id>/resourcegroups/<rg_name>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<vm_name>",
    "startDateTime": "2022-11-03T04:03:46.6517821Z",
    "endDateTime": null, //or a valid timestamp if present
    "impactCategory": "Resource.Availability", //valid impact category needed
    "workload": { "name": "webapp/scenario1" }
  }
}
```

```rest
az rest --method PUT --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<Subscription_id>/providers/Microsoft.Impact/workloadImpacts/<impact_name>?api-version=2022-11-01-preview"  --body <body_above>
