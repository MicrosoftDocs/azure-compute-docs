# Guest Health Reporting (preview) impact categories

To properly report issues to Guest Health Reporting, you must use an impact category that starts with `Resource.HPC`.

There are three main types of impact categories for high-performance computing (HPC):

* `Reset`: Request a refresh of the node health state.
* `Reboot`: Request a node start.
* `Unhealthy`: Issues are observed on the node. Take the node out of production for further diagnostics and repair.
