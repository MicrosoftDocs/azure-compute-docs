# Azure Impact Reporting FAQ (Preview)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Impact Reporting is currently in Preview. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Here are answers to common questions about Azure Impact Reporting.

## Is this a replacement for opening a support ticket?

No. Azure Impact Reporting is simply another tool that enables you to inform Microsoft that something may be wrong. In addition to being analyzed by different service teams, your impact reports are correlated with ongoing deployments to determine what action should be taken.

## What do I get as response to filing an Impact report?

Every Impact report is ingested by our internal correlation tools to help Microsoft provide you with better services and ease your pain. When there's a correlation, this will be indicated in the impact report.

## Who do I reach out to if I need to learn more about a previously filed Impact report?

Please email `impactrp-preview@microsoft.com`

## What Azure resource types are enabled for Impact reporting?
