Here are answers to common questions about Azure Impact Reporting.

## Is impact reporting a replacement for opening a support ticket?

No. Azure Impact Reporting is another tool that you can use to inform Microsoft that something might be wrong. Different service teams analyze your impact reports. Your reports are also correlated with ongoing deployments to determine what action should be taken.

## What do I get as a response to filing an impact report?

Our internal correlation tools ingest every impact report to help Microsoft provide you with better services. The impact report indicates when there's a correlation.

## Who do I contact if I need to learn more about a previously filed impact report?

Send an email to `impactrp-preview@microsoft.com`.

## What Azure resource types are enabled for impact reporting?
