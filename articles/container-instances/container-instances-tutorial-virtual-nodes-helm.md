# Tutorial: Deploy virtual nodes on Azure Container Instances in your Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

In this tutorial, you use Azure portal to deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. After deploying the AKS cluster, you use a Helm chart to deploy virtual nodes on Azure Container Instances.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have the following tools installed:

* Azure CLI
* kubectl (version 1.29+)
* Helm
* Git

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account][azure-free-account] before you begin.

## Create a virtual network for your AKS cluster

On the Azure portal home page, select **Create a resource**.

:::image type="content" source="media/container-instances-quickstart-portal/quickstart-portal-create-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to begin creating a new virtual network in the Azure portal.":::

Select **Networking** > **Virtual network**.

:::image type="content" source="media/container-instances-virtual-nodes-tutorials/virtual-nodes-virtual-network-create.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select a new virtual network that you want to create in the Azure portal.":::

On the **Basics** page, choose a subscription and enter the following values:

* Resource group: **Create new** > `virtualnodesresourcegroup`
* Virtual network name: `myvirtualnetwork`
* Region: `East US`

:::image type="content" source="media/container-instances-virtual-nodes-tutorials/virtual-nodes-virtual-network-basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to configure the Basics page for virtual network creation in the Azure portal.":::

On the **IP addresses** page, configure the following address spaces and subnets:

* 10.0.0.0/16: `default` subnet with size /24
* 10.1.0.0/16: `aks` subnet with size /16
* 10.2.0.0/16: `cg` subnet with size /16
  * The `cg` subnet must have a subnet delegation to `Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups`.
  * If your pods running in virtual nodes need outbound networking, you **must** set up a NAT gateway and configure the `cg` subnet to use it. Refer to [Configure a NAT gateway for static IP address for outbound traffic from a container group](./container-instances-nat-gateway.md) for instructions on this setup.

:::image type="content" source="media/container-instances-virtual-nodes-tutorials/virtual-nodes-virtual-network-ip-addresses.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to configure the IP addresses page for virtual network creation in the Azure portal.":::

Leave all other settings as their defaults, then select **Review + create**.

When the validation completes, you're shown a summary of the virtual network's settings. Select **Create** to submit your virtual network deployment request.

When deployment starts, a notification appears that indicates the deployment is in progress. Another notification is displayed when the virtual network has deployed.

## Create your AKS cluster

On the Azure portal home page, select **Create a resource**.

:::image type="content" source="media/container-instances-quickstart-portal/quickstart-portal-create-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to begin creating a new virtual network in the Azure portal.":::

Select **Containers** > **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.

:::image type="content" source="media/container-instances-virtual-nodes-tutorials/virtual-nodes-aks-cluster-create.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select a new AKS cluster that you want to create in the Azure portal.":::

On the **Basics** page, choose the same subscription you used for creating the virtual network and enter the following values:

* Resource group: `virtualnodesresourcegroup`
* Cluster preset configuration: `Dev/Test`
* Kubernetes cluster name: `virtualnodescluster`
* Region: `East US`
* Kubernetes version: Any version starting with `1.29.` - for example, `1.29.10`
* Automatic upgrade: `Enabled with patch`

:::image type="content" source="media/container-instances-virtual-nodes-tutorials/virtual-nodes-aks-cluster-basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to configure the Basics page for AKS cluster creation in the Azure portal.":::

On the **Node pools** page, select any VM SKU with at least 4 vCPUs and 16 GB RAM for the `agentpool` node pool. These nodes will be used to host the virtual nodes infrastructure. Do not select `Enable virtual nodes` - this refers to the previous [virtual nodes](/azure/aks/virtual-nodes) offering for AKS.

:::image type="content" source="media/container-instances-virtual-nodes-tutorials/virtual-nodes-aks-cluster-node-pools.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to configure the Node pools page for AKS cluster creation in the Azure portal.":::

On the **Networking** page, enter the following values:

* Network configuration: `Azure CNI Node Subnet`
* Bring your own Azure virtual network: `Enabled`
* Virtual network: `myvirtualnetwork`
* Cluster subnet: `aks`
* Kubernetes service address range: `10.4.0.0/16`
* Kubernetes DNS service IP address: `10.4.0.10`
* Network policy: `Calico`

:::image type="content" source="media/container-instances-virtual-nodes-tutorials/virtual-nodes-aks-cluster-networking.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to configure the Networking page for AKS cluster creation in the Azure portal.":::

Leave all other settings as their defaults, then select **Review + create**.

When the validation completes, you're shown a summary of the AKS cluster's settings. Select **Create** to submit your AKS cluster deployment request.

When deployment starts, a notification appears that indicates the deployment is in progress. Another notification is displayed when the AKS cluster has deployed.

## Assign permissions to the AKS cluster managed identity

When you deploy an AKS cluster, AKS creates a [node resource group](/azure/aks/faq#why-are-two-resource-groups-created-with-aks-) in the same subscription to host cluster infrastructure. By default, this resource group has a name like `MC_<resource group>_<AKS cluster>_<region>`. For this tutorial, the node resource group should have the name `MC_virtualnodesresourcegroup_virtualnodescluster_eastus`.

One of the resources created in the node resource group is a managed identity with the name `virtualnodescluster_agentpool`. Navigate to this managed identity and select **Azure role assignments**. Then add the following two role assignments:

* Scope: `Resource group`
* Subscription: `<your subscription name>`
* Resource group: `MC_virtualnodesresourcegroup_virtualnodescluster_eastus`
* Role: `Contributor`

This role assignment allows the creation of ACI container groups in the node resource group.

* Scope: `Resource group`
* Subscription: `<your subscription name>`
* Resource group: `virtualnodesresourcegroup`
* Role: `Contributor`

This role assignment allows ACI container groups to be injected into the virtual network you created in this resource group.

## Install virtual nodes on Azure Container Instances using the Helm chart

Use Azure CLI to pull down the configuration and credentials for the AKS cluster you created. This will configure kubectl for your AKS cluster.

`az login`

`az account set --subscription <your subscription ID>`

`az aks get-credentials --name virtualnodescluster --resource-group virtualnodesresourcegroup`

Additionally, we will register the ACI resource provider on your subscription so that you can deploy container groups.

`az provider register -n Microsoft.ContainerInstance`

Clone the [virtualnodesOnAzureContainerInstances](https://github.com/microsoft/virtualnodesOnAzureContainerInstances) GitHub repository. The Helm chart for installing virtual nodes on Azure Container Instances is located in the `Helm/virtualnode` folder.

Install the Helm chart using the following command:

`helm install virtualnode <cloned repository location>\Helm\virtualnode`

Within a minute, a new virtual node will be registered and in a Ready state in the AKS cluster. You can check the status of your AKS cluster nodes with kubectl.

`kubectl get nodes`

:::image type="content" source="media/container-instances-virtual-nodes-tutorials/virtual-nodes-aks-cluster-kubectl-nodes.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the output of the kubectl get nodes command, with a virtual node in a Ready state.":::

## Deploy your first pod to a virtual node

You can interact with virtual nodes like any other Kubernetes nodes. For example, the sample YAML below will deploy a pod onto the virtual node in your AKS cluster - note the use of node selectors and tolerations to place the pod appropriately. You can deploy the YAML using [kubectl apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_apply/).

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:    
  name: demo-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - /bin/bash
    - -c
    - 'counter=1; while true; do echo "Hello, World! Counter: $counter"; counter=$((counter+1)); sleep 1; done'
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli
    name: hello-world-counter
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 2250m
        memory: 2256Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
  nodeSelector:
    virtualization: virtualnode2
  tolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: virtual-kubelet.io/provider
    operator: Exists
```

After your pod is deployed, you can interact with it exactly as you would a "normal" Kubernetes pod.

For example, to see the pod status and events (useful for finding errors!):

`kubectl describe pods demo-pod`

To view logs for the pod:

`kubectl logs demo-pod`

To get a shell for the pod:

`kubectl exec demo-pod -it -- /bin/bash`

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created an AKS cluster in Azure portal, deployed virtual nodes on Azure Container Instances using a Helm chart, and deployed a pod onto your virtual node. Now you have basic familiarity with how to run Kubernetes pods on your virtual node, and you can utilize most Kubernetes capabilities and constructs on those pods out of the box!

If you are looking to utilize specialized virtual node capabilities or behaviors for your pods, see [Pod Customizations](https://github.com/microsoft/virtualnodesOnAzureContainerInstances/blob/main/Docs/PodCustomizations.md).

If you are looking to customize your virtual node installation, see [Node Customizations](https://github.com/microsoft/virtualnodesOnAzureContainerInstances/blob/main/Docs/NodeCustomizations.md).

If you are planning to deploy high-scale workloads (thousands of pods per minute) on virtual nodes, we have [best practices and recommendations](https://github.com/microsoft/virtualnodesOnAzureContainerInstances/blob/main/Docs/HighScaleBestPractices.md).
