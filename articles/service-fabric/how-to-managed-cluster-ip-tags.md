# Set up IP tags on a Service Fabric managed cluster (SFMC)

An IP tag represents a group of IP address prefixes from a given Azure service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the IP tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change, minimizing the complexity of frequent updates to network security rules. You can use IP tags to define network access controls on [network security groups](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview#security-rules), [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/service-tags), and user-defined routes. By adding IP tags, an SFMC cluster has an added layer of security. 
 
> [!NOTE]
> The `IPTag` property only applies to the public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the default cluster load balancer.

## Limitations

You shouldn't implement IP tags on existing clusters. 

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you [provisioned IPTags beforehand](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipaddress#example-3-create-a-new-public-ip-address-with-iptag).

## Modify your ARM template

When creating a new Service Fabric managed cluster, you need to add to the ARM template with the following property: 


```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedClusters",
  "apiVersion": "2021-07-01-preview",
  "properties": {
    "ipTags": [
      {
        "ipTagType": "string",
        "tag": "string"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then, deploy your SFMC cluster as normal.
