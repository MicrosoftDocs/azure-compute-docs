# Customer intent: As an operations engineer, I want to understand the differences between Azure CLI and Service Fabric CLI, so that I can effectively manage Azure resources and Service Fabric clusters according to my requirements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are two CLI utilities used to interact with Service Fabric. [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli) is used to manage Azure resources, such as an Azure-hosted Service Fabric cluster. [Service Fabric CLI](../service-fabric-cli.md) is used to directly connect to the Service Fabric cluster (regardless of where it's hosted) and manage the cluster, applications, and services.
