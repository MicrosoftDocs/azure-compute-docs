# Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for Azure Service Fabric

[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance)

page lists the **compliance domains** and **security controls** for Azure Service Fabric. You
can assign the built-ins for a **security control** individually to help make your Azure resources
compliant with the specific standard.
