# Customer intent: As an Azure user managing virtual machines, I want to migrate my unmanaged disks to managed disks before the retirement deadline, so that I can ensure continued operation and take advantage of the enhanced reliability and features of managed disks.

# Migrate your Standard HDD OS disks by September 08, 2028

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs

On September 8th, 2028, Standard HDD disks will no longer be able to be used as OS disks. At that time, all  Standard HDD disks that are being used as OS disks will be converted to Standard SSD disks. Before then, convert your these OS disks to either Standard SSD or Premium SSD to avoid potential service disruption.

If you're using Standard HDD as your OS disks, begin planning a migration now. Generally, Standard SSD provides the closest price to performance ratio as Standard HDD disks. If you need higher performance, migrate to Premium.

## How does this affect me?

- After September 30th, 2026, you won't be able to configure or deploy new Standard HDD disks as OS disks
- After September 8th, 2028, any existing virtual machines using Standard HDDs as their OS disks will automatically be converted to a Standard SSD of an equivalent size. Workloads on these disks may experience a service disruption if they're not migrated before September 8th, 2028.

## What is being retired?

This retirement is only for the ability to use Standard HDD disks as OS disks. All other managed disks, and ephemeral OS disks, aren't affected by this retirement.

## What actions should I take?

Start planning a migration to either Standard SSD or Premium SSD disks.

1. Make a list of all affected OS disks and VMs
    1. Disks with the **Storage type** set to **Standard HDD LRS** and **OS type** set to **Linux and Windows** on the [Azure portal's Disk Storage Center](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_StorageHub/StorageHub.MenuView/~/DisksBrowse) are all the affected disks within the subscription.
    1. The Owner column indicates the name of the virtual machine that uses the listed Standard HDD OS disks.
1. Learn how to convert your Standard HDD OS disks to either Standard SSD or Premium SSD disks.
1. For technical questions and issues, contact support.
