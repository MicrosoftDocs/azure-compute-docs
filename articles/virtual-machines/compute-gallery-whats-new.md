# What's new for Azure Compute Gallery

This article lists updates to Azure Compute Gallery features.

## July 2025 updates

- Starting with API version 2025-03-03, new Compute Gallery image definitions default to Hyper-V Generation `V2` and `SecurityType` set to `TrustedLaunchSupported`.
- Trusted Launch validation for Azure Compute Gallery images is [in preview](./azure-compute-gallery.md#trusted-launch-validation-for-azure-compute-gallery-images-preview) launched.
- The [`ExcludefromLatest`](/cli/azure/sig/image-version#az-sig-image-version-create) property excludes the use of an image version for creating resources to test images and safely rolling out the image to production. You can also set this property at the region level to exclude specific regions.
- The [`allowDeletionOfReplicatedLocations`](/rest/api/compute/gallery-image-versions/create-or-update?&tabs=HTTP#galleryimageversionsafetyprofile) property indicates whether or not removing the gallery image version from replicated regions is allowed and prevents accidental deletion of regions.
- The [`BlockDeletionBeforeEndOfLife`](/rest/api/compute/gallery-image-versions/create-or-update?&tabs=HTTP#galleryimageversionsafetyprofile) property enables customers to prevent deletion of image before the end-of-support date. You can opt out by explicitly setting `BlockDeletionBeforeEndOfLife` to `False`.
- [Platform metadata](/rest/api/compute/gallery-image-versions/create-or-update?&tabs=HTTP#platformattribute), such as publisher, offer, or product information from a virtual machine (VM) created from an Azure Marketplace image is carried over to the Compute Gallery image.

## January 2023 updates

- [Direct shared gallery](./share-gallery-direct.md?tabs=portaldirect) is in preview.
- [Best practices](./azure-compute-gallery.md#best-practices) information is available.
