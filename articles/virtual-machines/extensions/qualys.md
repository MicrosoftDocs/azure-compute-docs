# Qualys Agent on Linux or Windows VMs

The Qualys Cloud Agent is a lightweight, cloud-based security and monitoring tool installed on servers, virtual machines (VMs), and workstations. It continuously collects system data and sends it to Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform (ETP) for analysis and reporting.

Qualys supports Cloud Agent deployment on Windows and Linux Azure VMs via Microsoftâ€™s Azure portal. The [Cloud Agent Platform Availability Matrix](https://success.qualys.com/customersupport/s/cloud-agent-pam) provides more information about the supported platforms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Qualys has removed support for the Windows Cloud Agent extension version 3.1.3.34.  This version will become inoperable starting January 31, 2026. We recommend that you uninstall it and install the latest Windows Cloud Agent extension version (1.6.x.x) on your Azure portal. To learn more about the uninstallation steps, refer to [Uninstalling and Reinstalling Qualys Extension on Azure VMs](https://success.qualys.com/support/s/article/000007473).

The following are the different deployment methods to deploy Cloud Agent extensions on Azure VMs.

### Deploying Qualys Cloud Agent for Single Azure VM
