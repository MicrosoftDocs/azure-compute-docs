# Customer intent: As a cloud infrastructure administrator, I want to migrate my NCv3-series virtual machines to a supported VM size by the retirement date, so that I can maintain my workloads without service disruption and ensure ongoing performance enhancements.

# Migrate your NCv3-series virtual machines by September 30, 2025

> [!NOTE]
> The US Gov Virginia, US Gov Arizona, Jio India West, and China North 3 regions have an extension and a retirement date of **June 30th, 2026**. 
> The US Central region has an extension and a retirement date of **December 1st, 2025**. 
> If you are currently using the NCv3-series Azure VMs in a region above, you can disregard the general NCv3-series retirement date of September 30th, 2025, and continue to use the NCv3-series Azure VMs in that region until the respective extension date.   

On September 30, 2025, Microsoft Azure will retire the Standard_NC6s_v3, Standard_NC12s_v3, Standard_NC24s_v3, and Standard_NC24rs_v3 virtual machines (VMs) in NCv3-series virtual machines (VMs). To avoid any disruption to your service, we recommend that you change the VM sizing for your workloads from the current NCv3-series VMs to the newer VM series in the same NC product line.

Microsoft is recommending the Azure [NCadsH100_v5-series ](/azure/virtual-machines/ncads-h100-v5?source=recommendations)VMs, which offer greater GPU memory bandwidth per GPU, improved [accelerated networking](/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli) capabilities, and larger and faster local solid state drives. These VMs are targeted for GPU accelerated midrange AI training, batch inferencing, and high-performance computing simulation workloads. For regions where NCadsH100_v5 is not available, please migrate to the other recommended SKUs below. 

Depending on the workload being run, regional affinity, and cost preferences, other VMs that may be migrated to from the NCv3-series VMs include [NVadsA10_v5](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/gpu-accelerated/nvadsa10v5-series?tabs=sizebasic), [NCasT4_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/gpu-accelerated/ncast4v3-series?tabs=sizebasic), and [NVadsV710_v5](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/gpu-accelerated/nvadsv710-v5-series?tabs=sizebasic): 

|Workload|Recommended SKU to Migrate to|
| -------- | -------- |
|High GPU compute workloads such as real-time inferencing and LLM inferencing.|NCadsH100_v5 which has the best inference per dollar value.|
|Offline inferencing workloads where latency is not the primary concern, and there is an interest in purchasing smaller VM SKUs or reducing costs.|NCasT4_v3|
|Graphics, visualization, or small AI workloads where optimal performance is not a priority. |NVadsA10_v5, NVadsV710_v5|

## How does the retirement of the NCv3-series virtual machines affect me?

**After** **September 30th, any remaining** **NCv3-series virtual machines (VMs) subscriptions will be set to a deallocated state. They'll stop working and no longer incur billing charges. NCv3 will no longer be under SLA or have support included.** 

> [!Note]
> This retirement only impacts the virtual machine sizes in the original NCv3-series powered by NVIDIA V100 GPUs. This retirement announcement doesn't apply to NCasT4_v3, NC_A100_v4, and NCadsH100_v5 series virtual machines.

## What action do I need to take before the retirement date? 

You need to resize or deallocate your NCv3-series VMs. We recommend that you change VM sizes for these workloads from the original NCv3-series VMs to the NCadsH100_v5-series VMs (or an alternative).

The [NCadsH100_v5-series](/azure/virtual-machines/ncads-h100-v5?source=recommendations) is powered by NVIDIA H100 NVL GPU and 4th-generation AMD EPYC™ Genoa processors. The VMs feature up to 2 NVIDIA H100 NVL GPUs with 94GB memory each, up to 96 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC Genoa processor cores and 640 GiB of system memory. Check [Azure Regions by Product page](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/) for region availability. Visit the [Azure Virtual Machine pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/) for pricing information.

## Steps to change VM size 

1. Choose a series and size. Refer to the above tables for Microsoft’s recommendation. You can also file a support request if more assistance is needed.
2. [Request quota for the new target VM](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests).
3. You can [resize the virtual machine](resize-vm.md).
