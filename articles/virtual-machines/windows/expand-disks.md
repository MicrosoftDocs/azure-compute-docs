# Expand virtual hard disks attached to a Windows virtual machine

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets 

When you create a new virtual machine (VM) in a resource group by deploying an image from [Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/), the default operating system (OS) disk is usually 127 GiB. (Some images have smaller OS disk sizes by default.) You can add data disks to your VM. (The amount depends on the VM version you selected.)

We recommend that you install applications and CPU-intensive workloads on data disks. You might need to expand the OS disk if you're supporting a legacy application that installs components on the OS disk or if you're migrating a physical PC or VM from on-premises that has a larger OS disk. This article covers expanding either OS disks or data disks.

An OS disk has a maximum capacity of 4,095 GiB. However, many operating systems are partitioned with [master boot record (MBR)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record) by default. MBR limits the usable size to 2 TiB. If you need more than 2 TiB, create and attach data disks and use them for data storage. If you need to store data on the OS disk and require the extra space, [convert it to a GUID Partition Table](/windows-server/storage/disk-management/change-an-mbr-disk-into-a-gpt-disk) (GPT). To learn about the differences between MBR and GPT on Windows deployments, see [Windows and GPT FAQ](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-and-gpt-faq).

Unless you use [Expand without downtime](#expand-without-downtime), expanding a data disk requires the VM to be deallocated.

Shrinking an existing disk isn't supported and might result in data loss.

After you expand the disks, [expand the volume in the OS](#expand-the-volume-in-the-operating-system) to take advantage of the larger disk.

You can't expand the size of striped volumes.

## Expand without downtime

You can expand data disks without deallocating your VM. The host cache setting of your disk doesn't change whether or not you can expand a data disk without deallocating your VM.

This feature has the following limitations:

## Resize a managed disk in the Azure portal

If your disk meets the requirements in [Expand without downtime](#expand-without-downtime), you can skip step 1.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to the VM in which you want to expand the disk. Select **Stop** to deallocate the VM.
1. On the left menu under **Settings**, select **Disks**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expand-os-disk/select-disks.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Disks option selected in the Settings section of the menu.":::

1. Under **Disk name**, select the disk you want to expand.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expand-os-disk/disk-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Disks pane with a disk name selected.":::

1. On the left menu under **Settings**, select **Size + performance**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expand-os-disk/configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Size and performance option selected in the Settings section of the menu.":::

1. On **Size + performance**, select the disk size you want.

   The new size should be greater than the existing disk size. The maximum allowed is 4,095 GB for OS disks. It's possible to expand the virtual hard disk (VHD) blob beyond that size, but the OS works only with the first 4,095 GB of space.

1. Select **Resize** at the bottom of the page.

## Resize a managed disk by using PowerShell

Open your PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment or PowerShell window in administrative mode and follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Azure account in resource management mode, and select your subscription:

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    Select-AzSubscription â€“SubscriptionName 'my-subscription-name'
    ```

1. Set your resource group name and VM name:

    ```powershell
    $rgName = 'my-resource-group-name'
    $vmName = 'my-vm-name'
    $diskName = 'my-disk-name'
    ```

1. Obtain a reference to your VM:

    ```powershell
    $vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vmName
    ```

    If your disk meets the requirements in [Expand without downtime](#expand-without-downtime), you can skip steps 4 and 6.

1. Stop the VM before you resize the disk:

    ```powershell
    Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vmName
    ```

1. Obtain a reference to the managed OS disk. Set the size of the managed OS disk to the value that you want and update the disk:

    ```powershell
    $disk= Get-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $rgName -DiskName $diskName
    $disk.DiskSizeGB = 1023
    Update-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Disk $disk -DiskName $disk.Name
    ```

   The new size should be greater than the existing disk size. The maximum allowed is 4,095 GB for OS disks. It's possible to expand the VHD blob beyond that size, but the OS works only with the first 4,095 GB of space.

1. Updating the VM might take a few seconds. After the command finishes running, restart the VM:

    ```powershell
    Start-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vmName
    ```

Remote into the VM, open **Computer Management** (or **Disk Management**), and expand the drive by using the newly allocated space.

## Expand the volume in the operating system

After you expand the disk for the VM, go into the OS and expand the volume to encompass the new space. There are several methods for expanding a partition. This section covers connecting the VM by using a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection to expand the partition by using [DiskPart](#use-diskpart) or [Disk Manager](#use-disk-manager).

### Use DiskPart

1. Open an RDP connection to your VM.

1. Open a command prompt and enter `diskpart`.

1. At the `DISKPART` prompt, enter `list volume`. Make a note of the volume that you want to extend.

1. At the `DISKPART` prompt, enter `select volume <volumenumber>`. This action selects the volume `volumenumber` that you want to extend into contiguous, empty space on the same disk.

1. At the `DISKPART` prompt, enter `extend [size=<size>]`. This action extends the selected volume by size in megabytes (MBs).

### Use Disk Manager

1. Start a remote desktop session with the VM.
1. Open **Disk Management**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/expand-os-disk/disk-mgr-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Disk Management.":::

1. Right-click an existing **C:** drive partition and select **Extend Volume**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/expand-os-disk/disk-mgr-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to extend the volume.":::

1. Follow the steps in the wizard to see the disk with updated capacity.

    :::image type="content" source="media/expand-os-disk/disk-mgr-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the larger C: volume in Disk Manager.":::

## Expand without downtime classic VM SKU support

If you're using a classic VM SKU, or version, it might not support expanding disks without downtime.

Use the following PowerShell script to determine which VM versions it's available with:

```azurepowershell
Connect-AzAccount
$subscriptionId="yourSubID"
$location="desiredRegion"
Set-AzContext -Subscription $subscriptionId
$vmSizes=Get-AzComputeResourceSku -Location $location | where{$_.ResourceType -eq 'virtualMachines'}

foreach($vmSize in $vmSizes){
    foreach($capability in $vmSize.Capabilities)
    {
       if(($capability.Name -eq "EphemeralOSDiskSupported" -and $capability.Value -eq "True") -or ($capability.Name -eq "PremiumIO" -and $capability.Value -eq "True") -or ($capability.Name -eq "HyperVGenerations" -and $capability.Value -match "V2"))
        {
            $vmSize.Name
       }
   }
}
```
