# Customer intent: "As a solutions architect, I want to understand the capabilities of NP-series virtual machines, so that I can assess their suitability for accelerating workloads such as machine learning inference and video transcoding in my projects."
---
The NP-series virtual machines are powered by Xilinx U250 FPGAs for accelerating workloads including machine learning inference, video transcoding, and database search & analytics. NP-series VMs are also powered by Intel Xeon 8171M (Skylake) CPUs with all core turbo clock speed of 3.2 GHz.
