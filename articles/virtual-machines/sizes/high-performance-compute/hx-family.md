# 'HX' sub-family storage optimized VM size series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The 'HX' family of VM size series are one of Azure's high-memory, high-performance computing (HPC) optimized VM instances. They're built for tasks that need a lot of memory and strong CPU power. Examples include in-memory databases, big data analysis, and advanced scientific simulations. HX-series VMs, equipped with expansive memory and powerful CPUs, delivers the resources to efficiently handle large datasets and perform rapid data processing. They work well for financial services, scientific research, and business planning. These areas need real-time handling of large amounts of data to stay efficient and drive new ideas.

## Workloads and use cases

**In-Memory Databases:** HX-series VMs are excellent for hosting in-memory databases like SAP HANA, which require extensive memory to maintain large datasets in RAM for ultra-fast processing and access.

**Big Data Analytics:** They can handle big data analytics applications that need to process vast amounts of data in memory to speed up analysis, which is critical for real-time decision-making.

**Genomic Research:** Genomics research often involves large-scale data analysis, where high memory capacity can significantly enhance performance by allowing more of the dataset to be held in memory, speeding up the analysis.

**Financial Simulations:** Banks use HX-series VMs for fast trading and risk checks. These systems process huge amounts of data quickly to predict stock trends and figure out credit risks right away.

**ERP Systems:** HX-series VMs offer plenty of memory and strong processing power. Large business systems rely on these features to manage large amounts of data and keep many users working at once.
