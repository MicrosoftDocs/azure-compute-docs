# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to understand the features of the HX VM size series, so that I can determine if it meets the requirements for my memory-intensive and high-performance computing workloads."
---
The 'HX' family of VM size series are one of Azure's high-memory, high-performance computing (HPC) optimized VM instances. They're designed for memory-intensive workloads that require both large amounts of RAM and significant CPU performance, such as in-memory databases, big data analytics, and complex scientific simulations. Expansive memory and powerful CPUs on HX-series VMs provide the necessary resources to efficiently handle large datasets and perform rapid data processing. These VMs are designed for sectors like financial services, scientific research, and enterprise resource planning, where managing and analyzing large volumes of data in real-time is crucial for operational success and innovation.
