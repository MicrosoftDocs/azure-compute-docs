The 'HC' family of VM size series are one of Azure's high-performance computing (HPC) optimized VM instances. They're designed for compute-intensive workloads that require substantial CPU power, such as genomic sequencing, engineering simulations, and financial modeling. High-performance Intel Xeon Scalable processors and fast memory on HC-series VMs offer exceptional computational capabilities and memory bandwidth, making them ideal for applications that demand intense processing power to handle complex calculations and massive data sets efficiently. These VMs are designed for sectors like healthcare, finance, and engineering, where rapid data processing and simulation accuracy are critical for advanced research and development.
