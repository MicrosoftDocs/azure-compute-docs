#### Table definitions
- <sup>1</sup>Temp disk performance depends on many factors including block size, workload patterns of read/writes, queue depth (QD), and others. Temp disk performance specifications should be viewed as best case performance numbers, assuming 4k block sizes and QD=256 for IOPS, and 256k block sizes with QD=64 for throughput. Additionally, write performance is heavily impacted by how many blocks in use on a device. Temp disk write performance specs assume a device has a clean slate to enable the best performance. During steady state operations, write performance is expected to be lower than the published specs. 
- Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
- Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
- To learn how to get the best local storage performance for your VMs, see the [NVMe Temp Disk FAQ](/azure/virtual-machines/enable-nvme-temp-faqs).

#### Table definitions
- <sup>1</sup>Some sizes support [bursting](../../disk-bursting.md) to temporarily increase disk performance. Burst speeds can be maintained for up to 30 minutes at a time.
- <sup>2</sup>Special Storage refers to either [Ultra Disk](../../../virtual-machines/disks-enable-ultra-ssd.md) or [Premium SSD v2](../../../virtual-machines/disks-deploy-premium-v2.md) storage.
- Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
- Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
- Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to ReadOnly or ReadWrite. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to None.

| Standard_L16aos_v4 | 8 | 25,000 |
| Standard_L24aos_v4 | 8 | 37,500 |
| Standard_L32aos_v4 | 8 | 50,000 |

#### Networking resources
- [Virtual networks and virtual machines in Azure](/azure/virtual-network/network-overview.md)
- [Virtual machine network bandwidth](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput.md)

#### Table definitions
- Expected network bandwidth is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput.md)
- Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth.md). 
-  To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing.md).

### [Accelerators](#tab/sizeaccelerators)

Accelerator (GPUs, FPGAs, etc.) info for each size

> [!NOTE]
> No accelerators are present in this series.

---
> [!NOTE]
> This VM series will only work on OS images that support NVMe. If your current OS image doesn't have NVMe support, youâ€™ll see an error message. [NVMe](/azure/virtual-machines/enable-nvme-interface) support is available on the most popular OS images, and we're continuously improving OS image compatibility.
