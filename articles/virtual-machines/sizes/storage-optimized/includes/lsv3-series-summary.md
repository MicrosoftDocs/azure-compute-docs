# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to assess the capabilities of Lsv3-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for high-performance workloads like NoSQL databases with high IOPS and throughput requirements."
---
The Lsv3-series of Azure Virtual Machines (Azure VMs) features high-throughput, low latency, directly mapped local NVMe storage. These VMs run on the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a hyper-threaded configuration. This new processor features an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.5 GHz with Intel® Turbo Boost Technology, Intel® Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512) and Intel® Deep Learning Boost. The Lsv3-series VMs are available in sizes from 8 to 80 vCPUs. There are 8 GiB of memory allocated per vCPU, and one 1.92TB NVMe SSD device allocated per 8 vCPUs, with up to 19.2TB (10x1.92TB) available on the L80s_v3 size.

> [!NOTE] 
> The Lsv3-series VMs are optimized to use the local disk on the node attached directly to the VM rather than using durable data disks. This method allows for greater IOPS and throughput for your workloads. The Lsv3, Lasv3, Lsv2, and Ls-series VMs don't support the creation of a host cache to increase the IOPS achievable by durable data disks. 
> 
> The high throughput and IOPS of the local disk makes the Lsv3-series VMs ideal for NoSQL stores such as Apache Cassandra and MongoDB. These stores replicate data across multiple VMs to achieve persistence in the event of the failure of a single VM.
