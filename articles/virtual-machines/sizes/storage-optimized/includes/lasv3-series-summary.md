# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate the Lasv3-series of Azure VMs, so that I can determine their suitability for high-throughput workloads and NoSQL databases like Apache Cassandra and MongoDB.
---
The Lasv3-series of Azure Virtual Machines (Azure VMs) features high-throughput, low latency, directly mapped local NVMe storage. These VMs run on an AMD 3rd Generation EPYC&trade; 7763v processor in a multi-threaded configuration with an L3 cache of up to 256 MB that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.5 GHz. The Lasv3-series VMs are available in sizes from 8 to 80 vCPUs in a simultaneous multi-threading configuration. There are 8 GiB of memory per vCPU, and one 1.92 TB NVMe SSD device per 8 vCPUs, with up to 19.2 TB (10x1.92TB) available on the L80as_v3 size. 

> [!NOTE] 
> The Lasv3-series VMs are optimized to use the local disk on the node attached directly to the VM rather than using durable data disks. This method allows for greater IOPS and throughput for your workloads. The Lsv3, Lasv3, Lsv2, and Ls-series don't support the creation of a local cache to increase the IOPS achievable by durable data disks. 
> 
> The high throughput and IOPS of the local disk makes the Lasv3-series VMs ideal for NoSQL stores such as Apache Cassandra and MongoDB. These stores replicate data across multiple VMs to achieve persistence in the event of the failure of a single VM.
