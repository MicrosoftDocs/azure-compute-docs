# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate the Lsv2-series VM specifications, so that I can determine if they meet the performance and storage requirements for my high-throughput application workloads.
---
The Lsv2-series features high throughput, low latency, directly mapped local NVMe storage running on the AMD EPYCâ„¢ 7551 processor with an all core boost of 2.55GHz and a max boost of 3.0GHz. The Lsv2-series VMs come in sizes from 8 to 80 vCPU in a simultaneous multi-threading configuration. There is 8 GiB of memory per vCPU, and one 1.92TB NVMe SSD M.2 device per 8 vCPUs, with up to 19.2TB (10x1.92TB) available on the L80s v2.
