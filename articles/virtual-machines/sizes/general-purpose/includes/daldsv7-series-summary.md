# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate Daldsv7-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for cost-effective, non-memory intensive applications in my organization's infrastructure."
---
Daldsv7-series VMs utilize AMD's 5th Generation EPYC™  9005 processors that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of up to 4.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 160 vCPUs, 320 GiB of RAM. The Daldsv7-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU, memory and fast local NVMe temporary storage for most production workloads. These VM sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications. Daldsv7-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
