# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to review the specifications of the Dasv4-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for production workloads in my organization's infrastructure.

The Dasv4-series run on 2nd Generation AMD EPYC™ 7452 (up to 3.35GHz) or 3rd Generation EPYC™ 7763v processors (up to 3.5GHz) and use premium SSD. The Dasv4-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU, memory and temporary storage for most production workloads.
