# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to compare the Dsv6-series virtual machines with previous generations, so that I can determine the best option for upgrading our general-purpose workloads while optimizing performance and cost."
---
Dsv6-series virtual machines run on the 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8573C (Emerald Rapids) processor reaching an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.0 GHz . These virtual machines offer up to 128 vCPU and 512 GiB of RAM. Dsv6-series virtual machines provide a better performance for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation (for example, increased scalability, upgraded CPU, elevated memory bandwidth, faster remote storage access)

Dsv6-series virtual machines do not have any temporary storage thus lowering the price of entry. You can attach Standard SSDs, Standard HDDs, Premium SSDs, and Premium SSD V2 disk storage to these virtual machines. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
