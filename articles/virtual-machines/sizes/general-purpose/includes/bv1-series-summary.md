# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to assess the capabilities of B-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for burstable performance workloads like web servers and development environments in my organization."
---
The B-series VMs can be deployed on various hardware types and processors, so competitive bandwidth allocation is provided. B-series run on the third Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), the Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake), the Intel® Xeon® 8171M 2.1 GHz (Skylake), the Intel® Xeon® E5-2673 v4 2.3 GHz (Broadwell), or the Intel® Xeon® E5-2673 v3 2.4 GHz (Haswell) processors. B-series VMs are ideal for workloads that don't need the full performance of the CPU continuously, like web servers, proof of concepts, small databases, and development build environments. These workloads typically have burstable performance requirements. To determine the physical hardware on which this size is deployed, query the virtual hardware from within the virtual machine. The B-series provides you with the ability to purchase a VM size with baseline performance that can build up credits when its using less than its baseline. When the VM has accumulated credits, the VM can burst above the baseline using up to 100% of the vCPU when your application requires higher CPU performance.
