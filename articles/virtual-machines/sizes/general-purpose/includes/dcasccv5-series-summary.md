# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to deploy confidential child capable VMs using a parent VM, so that I can enhance isolation and security for sensitive workloads while optimizing resource utilization.
---
Confidential child capable VMs allow you to borrow resources from the parent VM you deploy, to create AMD SEV-SNP protected child VMs. The parent VM has almost complete feature parity with any other general purpose Azure VM (for example, D-series VMs). This parent-child deployment model can help you achieve higher levels of isolation from the Azure host and parent VM. These confidential child capable VMs are built on the same hardware that powers our Azure confidential VMs. Azure confidential VMs are now generally available. The DCas_cc_v5-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU and memory for most production workloads. These new VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads that do not require local temp disk.
