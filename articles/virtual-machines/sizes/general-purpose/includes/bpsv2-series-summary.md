# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate Bpsv2-series virtual machines, so that I can determine if their burstable performance capabilities are suitable for our development and testing workloads.
---
The Bpsv2-series virtual machines are based on the Arm architecture, featuring the Ampere® Altra® Arm-based processor operating at 3.0 GHz, delivering outstanding price-performance for general-purpose workloads. These virtual machines offer a range of VM sizes, from 0.5 GiB to up to 4 GiB of memory per vCPU, to meet the needs of applications that don't need the full performance of the CPU continuously, such as development and test servers, low traffic web servers, small databases, micro services, servers for proof-of-concepts, build servers, and code repositories. These workloads typically have burstable performance requirements. The Bpsv2-series VMs provides you with the ability to purchase a VM size with baseline performance that can build up credits when it's using less than its baseline performance. When the VM has accumulated credits, the VM can burst above the baseline using up to 100% of the vCPU when your application requires higher CPU performance.
