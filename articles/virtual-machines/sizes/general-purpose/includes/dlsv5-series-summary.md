# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate Dlsv5-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for cost-effective deployments while managing non-memory intensive applications and storage options."
---
Dlsv5-series virtual machines run on Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8473C (Sapphire Rapids), or Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 192 GiB of RAM. These VM sizes can reduce cost when not running memory intensive applications.

Dlsv5-series virtual machines don't have any temporary storage thus lowering the price of entry. You can attach Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. See pricing for disks.
