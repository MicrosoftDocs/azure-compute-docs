# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate Dalsv7-series VMs, so that I can determine their suitability for cost-effective deployment of non-memory intensive applications without the need for local temporary storage."
---
Dalsv7-series VMs utilize AMD's 5th Generation EPYC™ 9005 processors that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of up to 4.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 160 vCPU and 320 GiB of RAM. These VM sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications. The new VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads that don't require local temporary storage.
