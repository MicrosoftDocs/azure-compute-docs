# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to understand the specifications and capabilities of Dadsv7-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for my production workloads and storage requirements."
---
Dadsv7-series VMs utilize AMD's 5th Generation EPYC™ 9005 processors that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of up to 4.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 160 vCPU and 640 GiB of RAM. The Dadsv7-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU, memory and fast local NVMe temporary storage for most production workloads. Dadsv7-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
