# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate DCsv2-series virtual machines, so that I can ensure secure processing of sensitive data for applications like databases and machine learning while leveraging Intel SGX technology.
---
The DCsv2-series virtual machines help protect the confidentiality and integrity of your data and code while it’s processed in the public cloud. DCsv2-series leverage Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX), which enable customers to use secure enclaves for protection. These machines are backed by 3.7 GHz Intel® Xeon E-2288G (Coffee Lake) with SGX technology. With Intel® Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 these machines can go up to 5.0 GHz. Example confidential use cases include: databases, blockchain, multiparty data analytics, fraud detection, anti-money laundering, usage analytics, intelligence analysis and machine learning.

> [!NOTE]
> Hyperthreading is disabled for added security posture. Pricing is the same as Dv5 and Dsv5-series per physical core
