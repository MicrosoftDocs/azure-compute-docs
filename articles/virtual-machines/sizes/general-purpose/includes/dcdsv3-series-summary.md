# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate the DCdsv3-series Virtual Machines, so that I can determine how their enhanced security features and increased performance can meet my organization's data processing needs in a public cloud environment."

The DCdsv3-series Azure Virtual Machines help protect the confidentiality and integrity of your code and data while they're being processed in the public cloud. By using Intel速 Software Guard Extensions and Intel速 Total Memory Encryption - Multi Key, customers can ensure their data is always encrypted and protected in use. These machines are powered by the latest 3rd Generation Intel速 Xeon Scalable processors, and use Intel速 Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 to reach 3.5 GHz. With this generation, CPU Cores have increased 6x (up to a maximum of 48 physical cores). Encrypted Memory (EPC) has increased 1500x to 256 GB. Regular Memory has increased 12x to 384 GB. All these changes substantially improve the performance and unlock entirely new scenarios.
