# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to review the Dasv7-series virtual machine specifications, so that I can assess their suitability for my production workloads and optimize resources effectively.
---
Dasv7-series VMs utilize AMD's 5th Generation EPYC™ 9005 processors that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of up to 4.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 160 vCPU and 640 GiB of RAM. The Dasv7-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU and memory for most production workloads. The new VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads that don't require local temporary storage.
