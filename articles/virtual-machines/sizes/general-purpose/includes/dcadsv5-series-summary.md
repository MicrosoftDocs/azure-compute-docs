# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate the performance and security features of DCadsv5-series VMs, so that I can determine their suitability for confidential production workloads in my organization."
---
DCadsv5-series VMs offer a combination of vCPU and memory for most production workloads. These confidential VMs use AMD's third-Generation EPYCâ„¢  7763v processor in a multi-threaded configuration with up to 256 MB L3 cache. These processors can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.5 GHz. Both series offer Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). SEV-SNP provides hardware-isolated VMs that protect data from other VMs, the hypervisor, and host management code. Confidential VMs offer hardware-based VM memory encryption. These series also offer OS disk pre-encryption before VM provisioning with different key management solutions. DCadsv5-series offer a combination of vCPU, memory, and temporary storage for most production workloads.
