# Customer intent: "As a compliance officer, I want to understand the workload capabilities of DC-series VMs, so that I can ensure our sensitive data management aligns with regulatory requirements and industry standards."

**Data Protection:** DC-series VMs are ideal for applications that manage, store, and process sensitive data, such as personal identifiable information (PII), financial data, health records, and other types of confidential information. The hardware-based encryption ensures that data is protected at rest and during processing.

**Regulatory Compliance:** For businesses that need to comply with stringent regulatory requirements for data privacy and security (like GDPR, HIPAA, or financial industry regulations), DC-series VMs provide a hardware-assured environment that can help meet these compliance demands.
