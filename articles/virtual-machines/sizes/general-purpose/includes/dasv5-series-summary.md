Dasv5-series VMs utilize AMD's 3rd Generation EPYCâ„¢ 7763v processors that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.5GHz. The Dasv5-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU and memory for most production workloads. The new VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads that do not require local temp disk.
