Esv7-series virtual machines run on the Intel® Xeon® 6973PC (Granite Rapids) processor, reaching an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.6 GHz with a maximum turbo frequency is 4.2 GHz. This new processor features [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html), and [Intel&reg; Advanced Matrix Extensions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html)..virtual machines offer up to 372 vCPUs and 2,832 GiB of RAM. Esv7-series virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive workloads, such as relational database servers, large databases, data analytics engines, in-memory caches, and more.

Esv7-series virtual machines provide better performance for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation, for example increased networking, increased remote storage performance, upgraded CPU, and elevated memory bandwidth. Esv7-series virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive workloads, such as SQL and NoSQL database servers, data analytics engines, data warehousing workloads, business intelligence applications, in-memory databases such as SAP and Redis, and in-memory analytics and more.
