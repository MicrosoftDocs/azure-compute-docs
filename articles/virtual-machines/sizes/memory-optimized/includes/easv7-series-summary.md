# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate the Easv7-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for deploying memory-intensive enterprise applications without needing local temporary storage.
---
Easv7-series VMs utilize AMD's 5th Generation EPYC™ 9005 processors that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of up to 4.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 160 vCPU and 1280 GiB of RAM. The Easv7-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU and memory that is ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications. The new VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads that don't require local temporary storage.
