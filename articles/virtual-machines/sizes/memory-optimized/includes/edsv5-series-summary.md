Edsv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a [hyper threaded](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) configuration. This new processor features an all core turbo clock speed of 3.5 GHz with [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html) and [Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). These virtual machines offer up to 104 vCPU and 672 GiB of RAM and fast, local SSD storage up to 3800 GiB. Edsv5-series virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications and applications that benefit from low latency, high-speed local storage.

Edsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD and Standard HDD disk types. You can attach Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk storage to these VMs. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. See pricing for disks. The Edsv5-series virtual machines can burst their disk performance and get up to their bursting max for up to 30 minutes at a time.
