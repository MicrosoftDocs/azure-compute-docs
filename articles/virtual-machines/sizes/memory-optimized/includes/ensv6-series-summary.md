Ensv6-series virtual machines run on the 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8573C (Emerald Rapids) processor reaching an all- core turbo clock speed of up to 3.0 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 128 vCPU and 1024 GiB of RAM. Ensv6-series virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications and applications that benefit from low latency, high-speed local storage.  

Network Optimized VMs enhance accelerated networking by providing hardware acceleration of initial connection setup for certain traffic types, a task previously performed in software. These enhancements reduce the end-to-end latency for initially establishing a connection or initial packet flow, and allow a VM to scale up the number of connections it manages more quickly, subject to application constraints. 

The Ensv6 VMs offer up to 200 Gbps network bandwidth, 15 vNICs and up to 400k Connection per Second (CPS). The series also includes up to 128 vCPU and 1024 GiB of RAM.  

Both series provide up to 3x improvement in NW BW/vCPU than the current generation Intel Ev6 VMs. This series will be relevant for workloads such as network virtual appliances, large-scale e-commerce applications, express route, application gateway, and more that require the ability to handle a high number of user connections and data transfers. They're also suited for media processing tasks that involve transferring large amounts of data quickly, and other applications that benefit from high NW BW/vCPU and CPS & flow limit configurations.
