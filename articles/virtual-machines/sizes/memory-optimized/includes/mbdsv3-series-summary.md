# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate the Mbdsv3 VM series specifications, so that I can determine their suitability for high-performance storage-intensive applications such as relational databases and data analytics tasks.
---
The Memory-and-storage optimized Mbdsv3 VM series are based on the 4th generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors and deliver higher remote disk storage performance. These new VM sizes offer up to 650,000 IOPS and 10 GBps of remote disk storage throughput Premium SSD v2 and Ultra Disk, up to 4 TiB of RAM and up to 650,000 IOPS and 10 GBps throughput to remote disk storage with NVMe interface by using Ultra Disk and Premium SSD v2.

The increased remote storage performance of these VMs is ideal for storage throughput-intensive workloads such as relational databases and data analytics applications.
