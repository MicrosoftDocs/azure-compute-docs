The Memory-and-storage optimized Mbdsv3 series is based on the fourth generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors and delivers higher remote disk storage performance. These new VM sizes offer up to 650,000 IOPS and 10 GB/s of remote disk storage throughput (Premium SSD v2 and Ultra Disk), up to 4 TiB of RAM and up to 650,000 IOPS and 10 GB/s throughput to remote disk storage (with NVMe interface by using Ultra Disk and Premium SSD v2).

The increased remote storage performance of these VMs is ideal for storage throughput-intensive workloads such as relational databases and data analytics applications.  

The resource allocation and high-performance capabilities of the Mbdsv3 VM series make them particularly well suited for SQL Server workloads with high memory needs. Workloads such as critical [online transaction processing (OLTP)](/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/online-transaction-processing), [data analytics](/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/online-analytical-processing), [in-memory databases](/sql/relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/overview-and-usage-scenarios), [data warehousing](/azure/architecture/example-scenario/data/data-warehouse), and the consolidation of SQL Server workloads for efficient management of multiple SQL Server instances.
