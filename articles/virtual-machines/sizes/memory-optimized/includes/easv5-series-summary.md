Easv5-series utilize AMD's third Generation EPYCâ„¢ 7763v processors that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.5 GHz. The Easv5-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU and memory that is ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications. The new VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads that don't require local temp disk. Easv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
