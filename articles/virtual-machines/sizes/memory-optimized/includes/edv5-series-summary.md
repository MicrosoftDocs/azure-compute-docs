Edv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 104 vCPU and 672 GiB of RAM and fast, local SSD storage up to 3800 GiB. Edv5-series virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications and applications that benefit from low latency, high-speed local storage.

Edv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD and Standard HDD disk types. To use Premium SSD or Ultra Disk storage, select Edsv5-series virtual machines. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
