# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to understand the specifications and capabilities of the Eav4-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for memory-intensive enterprise applications in my infrastructure planning."
---
The Eav4-series run on 2nd Generation AMD EPYCTM 7452 (up to 3.35GHz) or 3rd Generation EPYCTM 7763v processors (up to 3.5GHz). The Eav4-series sizes are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications. Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. To use premium SSD, use the Easv4-series sizes. The pricing and billing meters for Easv4 sizes are the same as the Eav3-series.
