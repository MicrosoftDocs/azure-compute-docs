The Mdsv3 Very High Memory (VHM) series, powered by 4th generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8490H (Sapphire Rapids) processor with an all core base frequency of 1.9 GHz and 3.5 GHz single core turbo frequency, are the next generation of memory-optimized VM sizes delivering faster performance, lower total cost of ownership and improved resilience to failures compared to the previous generation. The Mv3 VHM sizes offer 32TB of memory, up to 8 GBps of throughput for remote storage, and provide up to 185 Gbps of networking performance with the current VHM generation.
