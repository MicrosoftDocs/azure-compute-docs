The 'M' family of VM size series are one of Azure's ultra memory-optimized VM instances designed for extremely memory-intensive workloads, such as large in-memory databases, data warehousing, and high-performance computing (HPC). Equipped with substantial RAM capacities and high vCPU capabilities, the M-family VMs support applications and services that require massive amounts of memory and significant computational power. High resource allocation makes the M-family particularly well-suited for handling tasks such as heavy SQL Server and other RDBMS workloads, complex scientific simulations, real-time data processing, and large-scale enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, ensuring peak performance for the most demanding data-centric applications.
