# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to understand the specifications and advantages of Ev4-series virtual machines, so that I can assess their suitability for deploying memory-intensive enterprise applications in my infrastructure.
---
Ev4-series sizes run on Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8473C (Sapphire Rapids), Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), or Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake). The Ev4-series instances are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications. Ev4-series VMs feature Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology.

Remote Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. To use premium storage disks, use the Esv4 sizes. The pricing and billing meters for Esv4 sizes are the same as Ev4-series.
