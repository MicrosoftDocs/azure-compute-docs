# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to review the EC sub-family VM size series, so that I can select the appropriate memory-optimized instances for my memory-intensive workloads requiring enhanced data protection and integrity.

The 'EC' sub-family of VM size series are one of Azure's security focused memory-optimized VM instances. They're designed for [confidential computing](/azure/confidential-computing/overview-azure-products) with enhanced data protection and integrity, featuring various hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These instances are ideal for memory-intensive workloads, such as large databases, big data analytics, and enterprise applications that require significant amounts of RAM to maintain high performance.
