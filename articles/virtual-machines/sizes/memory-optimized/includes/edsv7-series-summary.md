Edsv7-series virtual machines run on the Intel® Xeon® 6 6973PC (Granite Rapids) processor reaching an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.6 GHz with a maximum turbo frequency is 4.2 GHz. This new processor features [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html), and [Intel&reg; Advanced Matrix Extensions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html). These virtual machines offer up to 372 vCPUs and 2,832 GiB of RAM.Edsv7-series virtual machines provide better performance for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation, for example increased networking, increased remote storage performance, upgraded CPU, elevated memory bandwidth, faster NVMe local storage access, increased scalability, and larger local storage capacity.

Edsv7-series virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive workloads, such as SQL and NoSQL database servers, data analytics engines, data warehousing workloads, business intelligence applications, in-memory databases such as SAP and Redis, and in-memory analytics and more.
