# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to understand the specifications and capabilities of Esv5-series virtual machines, so that I can assess their suitability for my organization's workload requirements."

Esv5-series virtual machines run on Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8473C (Sapphire Rapids), or Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 104 vCPU and 672 GiB of RAM. Esv5-series virtual machines don't have temporary storage thus lowering the price of entry.

Esv5-series supports Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
