# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to review the specifications and performance capabilities of the Mv2-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for deploying memory-intensive applications and large in-memory databases."
---
The Mv2-series features high throughput, low latency platform running on a hyper-threaded Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8180M 2.5GHz (Skylake) processor with an all core base frequency of 2.5 GHz and a max turbo frequency of 3.8 GHz. All Mv2-series virtual machine sizes can use both standard and premium persistent disks. Mv2-series instances are memory optimized VM sizes providing unparalleled computational performance to support large in-memory databases and workloads, with a high memory-to-CPU ratio that is ideal for relational database servers, large caches, and in-memory analytics.
