# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate the specifications of Epsv5-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for memory-intensive and enterprise workloads in our infrastructure."
---
Epsv5-series virtual machines feature the Ampere® Altra® Arm-based processor operating at 3.0 GHz, which provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU. These virtual machines offer up to 32 vCPU and 208 GiB of RAM and are ideal for memory-intensive scale-out and most Enterprise workloads. Epsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types with no local-SSD support. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
