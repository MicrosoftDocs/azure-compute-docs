Eadsv5-series utilize AMD's third Generation EPYCâ„¢ 7763v processors that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.5 GHz. The Eadsv5-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU, memory, and temporary storage that is ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications. The new VMs have 50% larger local storage, and better local disk IOPS for both read and write compared to the Eav4/Easv4 sizes with Gen2 VMs. Eadsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
