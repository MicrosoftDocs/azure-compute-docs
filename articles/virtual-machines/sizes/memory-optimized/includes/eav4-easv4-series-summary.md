# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to understand the specifications and billing details of the Eav4 and Easv4-series virtual machines, so that I can select the appropriate instances for memory-intensive enterprise applications.

The Eav4-series and Easv4-series run on 2nd Generation AMD EPYCTM 7452 or 3rd Generation EPYCTM 7763v processors in a multi-threaded configuration. The Eav4-series and Easv4-series have the same memory and disk configurations as the Ev3 & Esv3-series and are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications. Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. To use premium SSD, use the Easv4-series sizes. The pricing and billing meters for Easv4 sizes are the same as the Eav3-series.
