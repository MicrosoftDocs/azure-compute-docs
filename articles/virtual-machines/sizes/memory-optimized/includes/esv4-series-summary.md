# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to assess the Esv4-series instance types, so that I can select the most suitable virtual machine sizes for my memory-intensive enterprise applications."
---
Esv4-series sizes run on Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8473C (Sapphire Rapids), Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), or Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake). The Esv4-series instances are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications. Evs4-series VMs feature Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology. Remote Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
