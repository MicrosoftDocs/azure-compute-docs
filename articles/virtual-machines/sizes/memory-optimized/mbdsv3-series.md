#### Table definitions
- Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3), remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
- Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
- IOPS/MBps listed here refer to uncached mode for data disks.
- To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see Virtual machine and disk performance.
- IOPS spec is defined using common small random block sizes like 4KiB or 8KiB. Maximum IOPS is defined as "up-to" and measured using 4KiB random reads workloads.
- TPUT spec is defined using common large sequential block sizes like 128KiB or 1024KiB. Maximum TPUT is defined as "up-to" and measured using 128KiB sequential reads workloads.

### [Remote Storage](#tab/sizestorageremote)

Remote (uncached) storage info for each size

| Size Name | Max Remote Storage Disks (Qty.) | Max Uncached Premium SSD Disk IOPS | Max Uncached Premium SSD Throughput (MB/s) | Max Uncached Ultra Disk and Premium SSD v2 IOPS | Max Uncached Ultra Disk and Premium SSD v2 Throughput (MB/s) |
