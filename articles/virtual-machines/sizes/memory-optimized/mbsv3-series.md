#### VM Basics resources
- [Check vCPU quotas](../../../virtual-machines/quotas.md)

### [Local Storage](#tab/sizestoragelocal)

Local (temp) storage info for each size

> [!NOTE]
> No local storage present in this series.
>
> For frequently asked questions, see [Azure VM sizes with no local temp disk](../../azure-vms-no-temp-disk.yml).



### [Remote Storage](#tab/sizestorageremote)

Remote (uncached) storage info for each size

| Size Name | Max Remote Storage Disks (Qty.) | Uncached Premium SSD Disk IOPS | Uncached Premium SSD Throughput (MB/s) | Uncached Ultra Disk and Premium SSD v2 IOPS | Uncached Ultra Disk and Premium SSD v2 Throughput (MB/s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard_M16bs_v3 | 64 | 44,000 | 1,000 | 64,000 | 1,000 |
| Standard_M32bs_v3 | 64 | 88,000 | 2,000 | 88,000 | 2,000 |
| Standard_M48bs_v3 | 64 | 88,000 | 2,000 | 120,000 | 2,000 |
| Standard_M64bs_v3 | 64 | 88,000 | 2, 000 | 160,000 | 2, 000 |

#### Storage resources

- [Azure managed disk types](../../../virtual-machines/disks-types.md)
- [Share an Azure managed disk](../../../virtual-machines/disks-shared.md)

#### Table definitions
- Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3), remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
- Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
- IOPS/MBps listed here refer to uncached mode for data disks.
- To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-performance).
- IOPS spec is defined using common small random block sizes like 4KiB or 8KiB. Maximum IOPS is defined as "up-to" and measured using 4KiB random reads workloads.
- TPUT spec is defined using common large sequential block sizes like 128KiB or 1024KiB. Maximum TPUT is defined as "up-to" and measured using 128KiB sequential reads workloads.


### [Network](#tab/sizenetwork)

Network interface info for each size

| Size Name | Max NICs (Qty.) | Max Network Bandwidth (Mb/s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard_M16bs_v3 | 8 | 8,000 |
| Standard_M32bs_v3 | 8 | 16,000 |
| Standard_M48bs_v3 | 8 | 16,000 |
| Standard_M64bs_v3 | 8 | 16,000 |
| Standard_M96bs_v3 | 8 | 25,000 |
| Standard_M128bs_v3 | 8 | 40,000 |
| Standard_M176bs_v3 | 8 | 50,000 |
