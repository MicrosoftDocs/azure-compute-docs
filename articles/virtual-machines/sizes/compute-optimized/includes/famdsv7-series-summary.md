# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to understand the specifications and capabilities of Famdsv7-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for my production workloads and storage requirements."
---
The Famdsv7-series utilizes AMD's 5th Generation EPYC™ 9005 processor that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of up to 4.5 GHz. The Famdsv7 VM series comes without Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), meaning a vCPU is now mapped to a full physical core, allowing software processes to run on dedicated and uncontested resources. These new full core VMs suit workloads demanding the highest CPU performance. Famdsv7-series offers up to 80 full core and 640 GiB of RAM. These VMs offer a combination of core and memory that is ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications. The new VMs with local disk are ideal for workloads that require local temporary storage. This series is optimized for scientific simulations, financial and risk analysis, gaming, rendering and other workloads able to take advantage of exceptional performance.
