# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to understand the specifications and capabilities of Fadsv7-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for my production workloads and storage requirements."
---
The Fadsv7-series utilizes AMD's 5th Generation EPYC™ 9005 processor that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of up to 4.5 GHz. The Fadsv7 VM series comes without Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), meaning a vCPU is now mapped to a full physical core, allowing software processes to run on dedicated and uncontested resources. These new full core VMs suit workloads demanding the highest CPU performance. Fadsv7-series offers up to 80 full core and 320 GiB of RAM. The new VMs with local disk are ideal for workloads that require local temporary storage. This series is optimized for scientific simulations, financial and risk analysis, gaming, rendering and other workloads able to take advantage of the exceptional performance.
