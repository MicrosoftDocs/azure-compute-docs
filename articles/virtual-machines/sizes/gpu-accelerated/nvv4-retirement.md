# Migrate your NVv4-series virtual machines by September 30, 2026
> [!NOTE]
> There is a known resize operation error that occurs when migrating from the NVv4-series to the NVadsV710_v5-series. Microsoft is working on a fix that will be implemented Q2 FY26. In the meantime, we suggest that you follow this [workaround]/azure/virtual-machines/azure-vms-no-temp-disk#how-do-i-migrate-from-a-vm-size-with-local-temp-disk-to-a-vm-size-with-no-local-temp-disk---).

> [!NOTE]
> 1-year and 3-year RI purchases for the NVv4-series will end September 30, 2025.  

On September 30, 2026, Microsoft Azure will retire the Standard_NV4as_v4, Standard_NV8as_v4, Standard_NV16as_v4, and Standard_NV32as_v4 virtual machines (VMs) in NVv4-series virtual machines (VMs). To avoid any disruption to your service, we recommend that you change the VM sizing for your workloads from the current NVv4-series VMs to the newer VM series in the same NV product line.

Microsoft is recommending the Azure [NVads_V710_v5-series](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/gpu-accelerated/nvadsv710-v5-series?tabs=sizebasic) VMs, which offer greater GPU memory bandwidth per GPU. The NVads_V710_v5-series VMs take advantage of the AMD Simultaneous Multithreading technology to assign dedicated vCPU threads to each VM and support NVMe for ephemeral local storage capability. 

The NVads_V710_v5-series enables right-sizing for demanding GPU-accelerated graphics applications and cloud-based virtual desktops to provide a seamless end user experience while providing a cost-effective choice for a full range of graphics-enabled virtual desktop experiences. The VMs are also sized to deliver high-quality, interactive gaming experiences in the cloud, optimized for rendering and streaming complex graphics. In addition, the NVads_V710_v5-series supports small to medium AI/ML inference workloads such as Small Language Model (SLMs), recommendation systems, and semantic indexing, by taking advantage of the computational IP blocks in the Radeon Pro V710 GPUs.

|Workload|Recommended SKU to Migrate to|
| -------- | -------- |
|Small AI workloads such as SLM inferencing and semantic search where optimal performance is not a priority or there is an interest in reducing costs.|NVads_V710_v5|
|GPU accelerated graphics applications, virtual desktops, and visualizations.|NVads_V710_v5|

## How does the retirement of the NVv4-series virtual machines affect me? 

__After__ __September 30th, 2026, any remaining__ __NVv4-series virtual machines (VMs) subscriptions will be set to a deallocated state. They'll stop working and no longer incur billing charges. NVv4 will no longer be under SLA or have support included.__

> [!NOTE]
> This retirement only impacts the virtual machine sizes in the NVv4-series powered by AMD Radeon Instinct MI25 GPUs. For NVv3-series virtual machines, please refer to the NVv3-series virtual machines retirement guide. This retirement announcement does not apply to NVadsA10_v5 or NVads_V710_v5 series virtual machines. 

## What action do I need to take before the retirement date? 

You need to resize or deallocate your NVv4-series VMs. We recommend that you change VM sizes for these workloads from the original NVv4-series VMs to the NVads_V710_v5-series VMs (or an alternative).

The [NVads_V710_v5-series](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/gpu-accelerated/nvadsv710-v5-series?tabs=sizebasic) is powered by AMD Radeon™ Pro V710 GPUs and AMD EPYC™ 9V64 F (Genoa) processors. The VMs feature up to 1 AMD Radeon™ Pro V710 GPU with 24GB memory each, up to 28 multithreaded AMD EPYC 9V64 F processor cores and 160 GiB of system memory. Check [Azure Regions by Product page](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/) for region availability. Visit the [Azure Virtual Machine pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/) for pricing information.

## Steps to change VM size

1. Choose a series and size. Refer to the above tables for Microsoft’s recommendation. You can also file a support request if more assistance is needed.

1. [Request quota for the new target VM](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests).

1. You can [resize the virtual machine](/azure/virtual-machines/resize-vm).
