# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to compare the NVadsA10v5-series virtual machines to select the right size for GPU-accelerated applications, so that I can optimize performance and resource utilization for graphics applications and virtual desktops."

The NVadsA10v5-series virtual machines are powered by NVIDIA A10 GPUs and AMD EPYC 74F3V(Milan) CPUs with a base frequency of 3.2 GHz, all-cores peak frequency of 4.0 GHz. With NVadsA10v5-series Azure is introducing virtual machines with partial NVIDIA GPUs. Pick the right sized virtual machine for GPU accelerated graphics applications and virtual desktops starting at 1/6th of a GPU with 4-GiB frame buffer to a full A10 GPU with 24-GiB frame buffer. Each virtual machine instance in NVadsA10v5-series comes with a GRID license. This license gives you the flexibility to use an NV instance as a virtual workstation for a single user, or 25 concurrent users can connect to the VM for a virtual application scenario.
