# Customer intent: "As a data scientist, I want to leverage NCv3-series VMs for HPC workloads, so that I can enhance performance in tasks like DNA sequencing and Monte Carlo simulations using advanced NVIDIA GPUs."
---
NCv3-series VMs are powered by NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs. These GPUs can provide 1.5x the computational performance of the NCv2-series. Customers can take advantage of these updated GPUs for traditional HPC workloads such as reservoir modeling, DNA sequencing, protein analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and others. The NC24rs v3 configuration provides a low latency, high-throughput network interface optimized for tightly coupled parallel computing workloads. In addition to the GPUs, the NCv3-series VMs are also powered by Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 (Broadwell) CPUs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For this VM series, the vCPU (core) quota in your subscription is initially set to 0 in each region. [Request a vCPU quota increase](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests) for this series in an [available region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/). These SKUs aren't available to trial or Visual Studio Subscriber Azure subscriptions. Your subscription level might not support selecting or deploying these SKUs.
