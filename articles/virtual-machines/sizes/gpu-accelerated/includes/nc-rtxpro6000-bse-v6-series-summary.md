These NC RTX PRO 6000 BSE v6 VMs are powered by NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, each featuring 96 GB of ultra-fast GDDR7 memory and the latest Blackwell architecture to enable breakthrough performance in multimodal AI, physical AI, and high-fidelity graphics. The VM host is equipped with Intel Granite Rapids CPUs, providing all-core turbo frequency of up to 4.2 GHz to handle demanding pre- and post-processing steps efficiently. These VMs are ideal for converged AI and visual computing workloads, such as:

- Real-time digital twin and NVIDIA Omniverse simulation.
- LLM Inference and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for models under 70B parameters.
- High-fidelity 3D rendering, product design, and video streaming.
- GPU-accelerated desktop virtualization (VDI) with NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation.
- Scientific visualization and High-Performance Computing (HPC) using FP32.
- Agentic AI application development and deployment.
