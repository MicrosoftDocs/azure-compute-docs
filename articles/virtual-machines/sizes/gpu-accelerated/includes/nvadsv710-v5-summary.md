The NVads V710 v5-series virtual machines are powered by AMD Radeon™ Pro V710 GPUs and AMD EPYC™ 9V64 F (Genoa) CPUs with a base frequency of 3.95 GHz and all-cores peak frequency of 4.3 GHz. VMs take advantage of the AMD Simultaneous Multithreading technology to assign dedicated vCPU threads to each VM. Both Windows and Linux VMs are supported.

The series provides five options ranging from 1/6 of a GPU with 4-GiB frame buffer to a full V710 GPU with 24-GiB frame buffer. No other GPU licensing is required for use of AMD GPU-based VMs. The NVads V710 v5 VMs also support NVMe for ephemeral local storage capability. The NVads V710 v5-series enables right-sizing for demanding GPU-accelerated graphics applications and cloud-based virtual desktops to provide a seamless end user experience while providing a cost-effective choice for a full range of graphics-enabled virtual desktop experiences. The VMs are also sized to deliver high-quality, interactive gaming experiences in the cloud, optimized for rendering and streaming complex graphics.

The NVads V710 v5-series virtual machines also support small to medium AI/ML inference workloads such as Small Language Model (SLMs), recommendation systems and semantic indexing, by taking advantage of the computational IP blocks in the Radeon Pro V710 GPUs.
