The 'ND' family of VM size series are one of Azure's GPU-accelerated VM instances. They're designed for deep learning, AI research, and high-performance computing tasks that benefit from powerful GPU acceleration. Equipped with NVIDIA GPUs, ND-series VMs offer specialized capabilities for training and inference of complex machine learning models, facilitating faster computations and efficient handling of large datasets. This makes them particularly well-suited for academic and commercial applications in AI development and simulation, where cutting-edge GPU technology is crucial for achieving rapid and accurate results in neural network processing and other computationally intensive tasks.
