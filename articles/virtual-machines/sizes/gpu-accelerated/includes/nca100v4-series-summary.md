The NC A100 v4 series virtual machine (VM) is a new addition to the Azure GPU family. You can use this series for real-world Azure Applied AI training and batch inference workloads. The NC A100 v4 series is powered by NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPU and third generation AMD EPYCâ„¢ 7V13 (Milan) processors. The VMs feature up to 4 NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPUs with 80 GB memory each, up to 96 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC Milan processor cores and 880 GiB of system memory. These VMs are ideal for real-world Applied AI workloads, such as:

GPU-accelerated analytics and databases
Batch inferencing with heavy pre- and post-processing
Autonomy model training
Oil and gas reservoir simulation
Machine learning (ML) development
Video processing
AI/ML web services
