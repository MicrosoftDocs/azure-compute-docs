# Customer intent: "As a data scientist, I want to utilize the NDm A100 v4 series virtual machines for deep learning and HPC workloads, so that I can leverage high-performance GPU resources for training AI models efficiently and effectively."
---
The NDm A100 v4 series virtual machine(VM) is a new flagship addition to the Azure GPU family. These sizes are designed for high-end Deep Learning training and tightly coupled scale-up and scale-out HPC workloads.

The NDm A100 v4 series starts with a single VM and eight NVIDIA Ampere A100 80GB Tensor Core GPUs. NDm A100 v4-based deployments can scale up to thousands of GPUs with an 1.6 TB/s of interconnect bandwidth per VM. Each GPU within the VM is provided with its own dedicated, topology-agnostic 200 GB/s NVIDIA Mellanox HDR InfiniBand connection. These connections are automatically configured between VMs occupying the same Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set, and support GPU Direct RDMA.

Each GPU features NVLINK 3.0 connectivity for communication within the VM with 96 physical 2nd-generation AMD Epycâ„¢ 7V12 (Rome) CPU cores behind them.

These instances provide excellent performance for many AI, ML, and analytics tools that support GPU acceleration 'out-of-the-box,' such as TensorFlow, Pytorch, Caffe, RAPIDS, and other frameworks. Additionally, the scale-out InfiniBand interconnect supports a large set of existing AI and HPC tools that are built on NVIDIA's NCCL2 communication libraries for seamless clustering of GPUs.
