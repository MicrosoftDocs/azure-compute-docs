# Supported OS images for remote NVMe

The following lists provide up-to-date information on which OS images are tagged as supported for remote NVM Express (NVMe).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only Gen2 VM images with security type "Standard" or "Trusted Launch" support NVMe. For more information, see [FAQ for NVMe](/azure/virtual-machines/enable-nvme-faqs#will-generation-1-vms-be-supported-with-nvme-disks-). Older operating systems cannot support NVMe due to OS driver limitations. If an older version of the OS is not included in the list below, it means that NVMe support is not present for that OS.

For specifics about which virtual machine (VM) generations support which storage types, check the [documentation about VM sizes in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes).

For more information about enabling the NVMe interface on virtual machines created in Azure, review the [FAQ for remote NVMe disks](/azure/virtual-machines/enable-nvme-remote-faqs).

## Supported Linux OS images
> [!NOTE]
> For Linux virtual machines using NVMe-attached storage, Microsoft recommends setting the kernel parameter `nvme_core.io_timeout` to `240` seconds. This setting effectively disables OS-level NVMe IO timeouts, ensuring that Azure's host-level timeout mechanism takes precedence to handle disk failures or interruptions. 
> Some older Linux images may have the default `io_timeout` set to 30 seconds, which can cause the OS to timeout IOs before Azure can intervene.
