# Trusted Launch for Azure virtual machines

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

Azure offers Trusted Launch as a seamless way to improve the security of [Generation 2](generation-2.md) virtual machines (VM). Trusted Launch protects against advanced and persistent attack techniques. Trusted Launch is composed of several coordinated infrastructure technologies that can be enabled independently. Each technology provides another layer of defense against sophisticated threats.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Trusted Launch is the default state for newly created Azure Gen2 VM and scale sets. See the [Trusted Launch FAQs](trusted-launch-faq.md) if your new VM requires features that [aren't supported with Trusted launch](trusted-launch.md#unsupported-features).
> - [Existing VM](overview.md) can have Trusted Launch enabled after being created. For more information, see [Enable Trusted Launch on existing VMs](trusted-launch-existing-vm.md).
> - Existing [virtual machine scale set](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview.md) can have Trusted Launch enabled after being created. For more information, see [Enable Trusted Launch on existing scale set](trusted-launch-existing-vmss.md).

## Benefits

- Securely deploy VMs with verified boot loaders, operating system (OS) kernels, and drivers.
- Securely protect keys, certificates, and secrets in the VMs.
- Gain insights and confidence of the entire boot chain's integrity.
- Ensure that workloads are trusted and verifiable.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Installation of the *CUDA & GRID drivers on Secure Boot-enabled Windows VMs* doesn't require any extra steps.
> - Installation of the *CUDA driver on Secure Boot-enabled Ubuntu VMs* requires extra steps. For more information, see [Install NVIDIA GPU drivers on N-series VMs running Linux](./linux/n-series-driver-setup.md#install-cuda-drivers-on-n-series-vms). Secure Boot should be disabled for installing CUDA drivers on other Linux VMs.
> - Installation of the *GRID driver* requires Secure Boot to be disabled for Linux VMs.
> - *Not supported* size families don't support [Generation 2](generation-2.md) VMs. Change the VM size to equivalent *supported size families* for enabling Trusted Launch.

## More information

**Regions**:

- All public regions
- All Azure Government regions
- All Azure China regions

**Pricing**:
Trusted Launch doesn't increase existing VM pricing costs.

## Unsupported features

Currently, the following VM features aren't supported with Trusted Launch:

- [Azure Site Recovery](/azure/site-recovery/concepts-trusted-vm) (*Generally available for Windows, Public preview for Linux*).
- [Managed Image](capture-image-resource.yml) (customers are encouraged to use [Azure Compute Gallery](trusted-launch-portal.md#trusted-launch-vm-supported-images)).
- [Linux VM Hibernation](./linux/hibernate-resume-linux.md)

## Secure Boot

At the root of Trusted Launch is Secure Boot for your VM. Secure Boot, which is implemented in platform firmware, protects against the installation of malware-based rootkits and boot kits. Secure Boot works to ensure that only signed operating systems and drivers can boot. It establishes a "root of trust" for the software stack on your VM.

With Secure Boot enabled, all OS boot components (boot loader, kernel, kernel drivers) require trusted publishers signing. Both Windows and select Linux distributions support Secure Boot. If Secure Boot fails to authenticate that the image is signed with a trusted publisher, the VM fails to boot. For more information, see [Secure Boot](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot).

## vTPM

Trusted Launch also introduces virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) for Azure VMs. This virtualized version of a hardware [Trusted Platform Module](/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview) is compliant with the TPM2.0 spec. It serves as a dedicated secure vault for keys and measurements.

Trusted Launch provides your VM with its own dedicated TPM instance that runs in a secure environment outside the reach of any VM. The vTPM enables [attestation](/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/tpm-fundamentals#measured-boot-with-support-for-attestation) by measuring the entire boot chain of your VM (UEFI, OS, system, and drivers).

Trusted Launch uses the vTPM to perform remote attestation through the cloud. Attestations enable platform health checks and are used for making trust-based decisions. As a health check, Trusted Launch can cryptographically certify that your VM booted correctly.

If the process fails, possibly because your VM is running an unauthorized component, Microsoft Defender for Cloud issues integrity alerts. The alerts include details on which components failed to pass integrity checks.

## Virtualization-based security

[Virtualization-based security](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs) (VBS) uses the hypervisor to create a secure and isolated region of memory. Windows uses these regions to run various security solutions with increased protection against vulnerabilities and malicious exploits. Trusted Launch lets you enable hypervisor code integrity (HVCI) and Windows Defender Credential Guard.

HVCI is a powerful system mitigation that protects Windows kernel-mode processes against injection and execution of malicious or unverified code. It checks kernel mode drivers and binaries before they run, preventing unsigned files from loading into memory. Checks ensure that executable code can't be modified after it's allowed by HVCI to load. For more information about VBS and HVCI, see [Virtualization-based security and hypervisor-enforced code integrity](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-insider-program/virtualization-based-security-vbs-and-hypervisor-enforced-code/m-p/240571).

With Trusted Launch and VBS, you can enable Windows Defender Credential Guard. Credential Guard isolates and protects secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. It helps prevent unauthorized access to secrets and credential theft attacks, like Pass-the-Hash attacks. For more information, see [Credential Guard](/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard).

## Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration

Trusted Launch is integrated with Defender for Cloud to ensure that your VMs are properly configured. Defender for Cloud continually assesses compatible VMs and issues relevant recommendations:

- **Recommendation to enable Secure Boot**: The Secure Boot recommendation only applies for VMs that support Trusted Launch. Defender for Cloud identifies VMs that have Secure boot disabled. It issues a low-severity recommendation to enable it.
- **Recommendation to enable vTPM**: If vTPM is enabled for VM, Defender for Cloud can use it to perform guest attestation and identify advanced threat patterns. If Defender for Cloud identifies VMs that support Trusted Launch with vTPM disabled, it issues a low-severity recommendation to enable it.
- **Recommendation to install guest attestation extension**: If your VM has Secure Boot and vTPM enabled but it doesn't have the Guest Attestation extension installed, Defender for Cloud issues low-severity recommendations to install the Guest Attestation extension on it. This extension allows Defender for Cloud to proactively attest and monitor the boot integrity of your VMs. Boot integrity is attested via remote attestation.
- **Attestation health assessment or boot integrity monitoring**: If your VM has Secure Boot and vTPM enabled and the Attestation extension installed, Defender for Cloud can remotely validate that your VM booted in a healthy way. This practice is known as boot integrity monitoring. Defender for Cloud issues an assessment that indicates the status of remote attestation.

   If your VMs are properly set up with Trusted Launch, Defender for Cloud can detect and alert you of VM health problems.

- **Alert for VM attestation failure**: Defender for Cloud periodically performs attestation on your VMs. The attestation also happens after your VM boots. If the attestation fails, it triggers a medium-severity alert.
    VM attestation can fail for the following reasons:
  - The attested information, which includes a boot log, deviates from a trusted baseline. Any deviation can indicate that untrusted modules are loaded, and the OS could be compromised.
  - The attestation quote couldn't be verified to originate from the vTPM of the attested VM. An unverified origin can indicate that malware is present and could be intercepting traffic to the vTPM.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Alerts are available for VMs with vTPM enabled and the Attestation extension installed. Secure Boot must be enabled for attestation to pass. Attestation fails if Secure Boot is disabled. If you must disable Secure Boot, you can suppress this alert to avoid false positives.

- **Alert for untrusted Linux kernel module**: For Trusted Launch with Secure Boot enabled, it's possible for a VM to boot even if a kernel driver fails validation and is prohibited from loading. If kernel driver validation failure happens, Defender for Cloud issues low-severity alerts. While there's no immediate threat, because the untrusted driver didn't load, these events should be investigated. Ask yourself:

  - Which kernel driver failed? Am I familiar with the failed kernel driver and do I expect it to load?
  - Is the exact version of the driver same as expected? Are the driver binaries intact? If failed driver is a partner driver, did the partner pass the OS compliance tests to get it signed?

## (Preview) Trusted Launch as default

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Trusted Launch default is currently in preview. This Preview is intended for testing, evaluation, and feedback purposes only. Production workloads aren't recommended. When registering to preview, you agree to the [supplemental terms of use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). Some aspects of this feature might change with general availability (GA).

Trusted Launch as default (TLaD) is available in preview for new Gen2 Virtual machines (VM) and Virtual machine scale sets (scale sets).

TLaD is a fast and zero-touch means of improving the security posture of new Gen2 based Azure VM and Virtual Machine Scale Sets deployments. With Trusted Launch as default, any new Gen2 VMs or scale sets created through any client tools (like ARM template, Bicep) defaults to Trusted Launch VMs with secure boot and vTPM enabled.

The public preview release allows you to validate these changes in your respective environment for all new Azure Gen2 VM, scale set, and prepare for this upcoming change.

> [!NOTE]
>
> All new Gen2 VM, scale set, deployments using any client tool (ARM template, Bicep, Terraform, etc.) defaults to Trusted launch post on-boarding to preview. This change does NOT override inputs provided as part of the deployment code.

### Enable TLaD preview

Register preview feature `TrustedLaunchByDefaultPreview` under `Microsoft.Compute` namespace on virtual machine  subscription. For more information, see [Set up preview features in Azure subscription](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/preview-features)

To create a new Gen2 VM or scale set with Trusted launch default, execute your existing deployment script as is through Azure SDK, Terraform, or another method that isn't Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. The new VM or scale set created in the registered subscription results in a Trusted Launch VM or Virtual Machine Scale Set.

### VM & scale sets deployments with TLaD preview

#### Existing behavior

To create Trusted launch VM & scale set, you need to add following securityProfile element in deployment:

```json
"securityProfile": {
    "securityType": "TrustedLaunch",
    "uefiSettings": {
        "secureBootEnabled": true,
        "vTpmEnabled": true,
    }
}
```

Absence of securityProfile element in deployment code deploys VM & scale set without enabling Trusted launch.

**Examples**

- [vm-windows-admincenter](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/quickstarts/microsoft.compute/vm-windows-admincenter/azuredeploy.json) – The Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template deploys Gen2 VM without enabling Trusted launch.
- [vm-simple-windows](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/quickstarts/microsoft.compute/vm-simple-windows/azuredeploy.json) – The ARM template deploys Trusted launch VM (without default as `securityProfile` is explicitly added to ARM template)

#### New behavior

By using API version 2021-11-01 or higher AND [on-boarding to preview](trusted-launch.md#enable-tlad-preview), absence of `securityProfile` element from deployment will enable Trusted launch by default to new VM & scale set deployed if following conditions are met:

- Source Marketplace [OS image supports Trusted launch](trusted-launch.md#operating-systems-supported).
- Source ACG OS image supports and is validated for Trusted launch.
- Source disk supports Trusted launch.
- [VM size supports Trusted launch](trusted-launch.md#virtual-machines-sizes).

The deployment won't default to Trusted launch if one ore more of the listed condition(s) aren't met and complete successfully to create new Gen2 VM & scale set without Trusted launch.

You can choose to explicitly bypass default for VM & scale set deployment by setting `Standard` as value of parameter `securityType`. For more information, see [Can I disable Trusted Launch for a new VM deployment](trusted-launch-faq.md#can-i-disable-trusted-launch-for-a-new-vm-deployment).

#### Known limitations

***Unable to bypass Trusted launch default and create Gen2 (Non-Trusted launch) VM using Azure portal after registering to preview.***

After registering subscription to preview, setting security type to `Standard` in Azure portal will deploy the VM or scale set `Trusted launch`. This limitation will be addressed prior to the Trusted launch default general availability.

To mitigate this limitation, you can [un-register the preview feature](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/preview-features#unregister-preview-feature) by removing feature flag `TrustedLaunchByDefaultPreview` under `Microsoft.Compute` namespace on given subscription.

***Unable to re-size VM or VMSS to un-supported Trusted launch VM size family (like M-Series) post default to Trusted launch.***

Re-sizing Trusted launch VM to [VM size family not supported with Trusted launch](trusted-launch.md#virtual-machines-sizes) will not be supported.

As mitigation, please register feature flag `UseStandardSecurityType` under `Microsoft.Compute` namespace AND roll-back VM from Trusted launch to Gen2-only (Non-Trusted launch) by setting `securityType = Standard` using available client tools (except Azure portal).

### TLaD preview feedback

Reach out to us with any feedback, queries, or concerns regarding this upcoming change at [Trusted launch default preview feedback survey](https://aka.ms/TrustedLaunchDefault/Feedback).

### Disable TLaD preview

To disable the TLaD preview, unregister the preview feature `TrustedLaunchByDefaultPreview` under `Microsoft.Compute` namespace on virtual machine  subscription. For more information, see [Unregister preview feature](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/preview-features#unregister-preview-feature)
