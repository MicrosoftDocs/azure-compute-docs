# (Preview) Upgrade existing Azure Gen1 VMs to Trusted launch

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VM :heavy_check_mark: Windows VM :heavy_check_mark: Generation 1 VM

Azure Virtual Machines supports upgrading Generation 1 virtual machines (VM) to [Generation 2](generation-2.md) by upgrading to the [Trusted launch](trusted-launch.md) security type.

[Trusted launch](trusted-launch.md) is a way to enable foundational compute security on [Azure Generation 2 VMs](generation-2.md) and protects against advanced and persistent attack techniques like boot kits and rootkits. It does so by combining infrastructure technologies like Secure Boot, virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM), and boot integrity monitoring on your VM.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for *upgrade of existing Gen1 VMs to Trusted launch* is currently in preview. *Upgrade of Gen1 VMs to Gen2 without enabling Trusted launch* is **not supported**.

## Prerequisites

- Subscription is on-boarded to preview feature `Gen1ToTLMigrationPreview` under `Microsoft.Compute` namespace. Refer to [Set up preview features in Azure subscription](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/preview-features)
- Azure VM is configured with:
  - [Trusted launch supported size family](trusted-launch.md#virtual-machines-sizes).
  - [Trusted launch supported operating system (OS) version](trusted-launch.md#operating-systems-supported) (*excluding Windows Server 2016, Debian, Azure Linux*). For custom OS images or disks, the base image should be *Trusted launch capable*.
- Azure VM isn't using [features currently not supported with Trusted launch](trusted-launch.md#unsupported-features).
- Azure Backup, if enabled, for VMs should be configured with the [Enhanced Backup policy](/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-enhanced-policy). The Trusted launch security type can't be enabled for VMs configured with *Standard policy* backup protection.
  - Existing Azure VM backup can be migrated from the *Standard* to the *Enhanced* policy. Follow the steps in [Migrate Azure VM backups from Standard to Enhanced policy (preview)](/azure/backup/backup-azure-vm-migrate-enhanced-policy).
- Upgrade a test Gen1 VM to Trusted launch and determine if any changes are required to meet the prerequisites before you upgrade Gen1 VMs associated with production workloads to Trusted launch.
- Disable any *Windows OS volume encryption* including BitLocker before upgrade if enabled. All Windows OS volume encryptions should be re-enabled post successful upgrade. This action isn't required for data disks or Linux OS volume.

## Unsupported Gen1 VM configurations

Gen1 to Trusted launch VM upgrade is **NOT** supported if Gen1 VM is configured with:

- **Production workloads**: The preview feature should only be used for testing, evaluation, and feedback. Production workloads aren't recommended.
- **Operating system**: Windows Server 2016, Azure Linux, Debian, and any other operating system not listed under [Trusted launch supported operating system (OS) version](trusted-launch.md#operating-systems-supported). For *Windows Server 2016 only*, workaround is to [update the Guest OS to Windows Server 2019 or 2022](windows-in-place-upgrade.md#perform-in-place-upgrade-to-windows-server-2016-2019-or-2022).
- **VM size**: Gen1 VM configured with VM size not listed under [Trusted launch supported size families](trusted-launch.md#virtual-machines-sizes). As workaround, update the VM size to Trusted launch supported VM size family.
- **Azure Backup**: Gen1 VM configured with Azure Backup using *Standard policy*. As workaround, [migrate Gen1 VM backups from Standard to Enhanced policy](/azure/backup/backup-azure-vm-migrate-enhanced-policy).
- **BitLocker or equivalent encryption**: Windows Gen1 VM *guest OS volume* is encrypted using BitLocker or equivalent encryption technology. As workaround, disable Windows OS volume encryption before upgrade and re-enable post successful completion of Trusted launch upgrade.

## Best practices

- [Create restore points](create-restore-points.md) for Azure VMs associated with production workloads before you enable the Trusted launch security type. You can use the restore points to re-create the disks and VM with the previous well-known state.
- Review [known issues](#known-issues) before executing Trusted launch upgrade.
- You won't be able to extend Windows OS disk system volume after `MBR to GPT conversion` as part of upgrade. Recommendation is to extend system volume for future before upgrading to Trusted launch.
- *Windows OS disk volume* should be defragmented using command `Defrag C: /U /V`. Defragmentation of OS volume reduces the risk of MBR (Master boot record) to GPT (GUID partition table) conversion failure by freeing up end of partitions. Refer to [defrag](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/defrag).

## Update Guest OS volume

[Generation 2](generation-2.md) VMs requires guest OS volume with following configurations:

- **GPT Disk layout**: Guest OS volume of Gen1 VMs is mostly set to `MBR` and requires to be updated to `GPT`
- **EFI system partition**: Guest OS volume of Gen1 VMs mostly doesn't include this partition.

Complete the update of OS volume with required configuration before upgrading Azure Gen1 VM to Trusted launch.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Upgrade a test Gen1 VM to Trusted launch and determine if any changes are required to meet the prerequisites before you upgrade Gen1 VMs associated with production workloads to Trusted launch.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

Using in-built [MBR2GPT.exe](/windows/deployment/mbr-to-gpt) utility, you can enable `GPT` disk layout AND add `EFI system partition` required for Gen2 upgrade.

> [!CAUTION]
> You will not be able to extend Windows OS disk system volume after `MBR to GPT conversion`. Recommendation is to extend system volume for future before executing the upgrade.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Server 2016 does not support `MBR2GPT.exe`. Workaround is to update the Guest OS to Windows Server 2019 or 2022 and then perform `MBR to GPT conversion`. Refer to [In-place upgrade for VMs running Windows Server in Azure](windows-in-place-upgrade.md#perform-in-place-upgrade-to-windows-server-2016-2019-or-2022).

1. RDP or remotely connect to Gen1 Windows VM for executing conversion.
2. Run command `MBR2GPT /validate /allowFullOS` and ensure `Disk layout validation` completes successfully. **Do not proceed** if the `Disk layout validation` fails. Refer to [Known issues](#known-issues) for list of common causes and associated resolution for failure. For more information and troubleshooting, see [MBR2GPT troubleshooting](/windows/deployment/mbr-to-gpt#troubleshooting).
3. Run command `MBR2GPT /convert /allowFullOS` to **execute** MBR to GPT conversion. Sample successful output:

    ```log
    If conversion is successful the disk can only be booted in GPT mode.
    These changes cannot be undone!
    
    MBR2GPT: Attempting to convert disk 0
    MBR2GPT: Retrieving layout of disk
    MBR2GPT: Validating layout, disk sector size is: 512 bytes
    MBR2GPT: Trying to shrink the OS partition
    MBR2GPT: Creating the EFI system partition
    MBR2GPT: Installing the new boot files
    MBR2GPT: Performing the layout conversion
    MBR2GPT: Migrating default boot entry
    MBR2GPT: Adding recovery boot entry
    MBR2GPT: Fixing drive letter mapping
    MBR2GPT: Conversion completed successfully
    MBR2GPT: Before the new system can boot properly you need to switch the firmware to boot to UEFI mode!
    ```

### [Linux](#tab/linux)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Upgrade of existing Azure Gen1 Linux VMs to Trusted launch is **only supported** for VMs created using [supported OS](trusted-launch.md#operating-systems-supported) images published in Azure Marketplace (*excluding Debian, Azure Linux*).

Azure Gen1 Linux VMs created using endorsed distros (Canonical, RHEL, SUSE) images published in [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) don't require any change in Guest OS volume. That is, they already have `GPT` disk layout and `EFI system partition` configured. For other Azure Gen1 Linux VMs requiring this upgrade support including Azure Linux & Debian, submit registration at [Linux Gen1 to Trusted launch upgrade support](https://aka.ms/Gen1ToTLUpgrade).

Validate Guest OS volume readiness for Trusted launch upgrade with following commands. **DO NOT** proceed with Trusted launch upgrade if any of the validation step fails.

1. SSH or remotely connect to Gen1 Linux VM for executing validation commands.

2. Identify boot device and store in variable.<br/>
    `bootDevice=$(echo "/dev/$(sudo lsblk -no pkname $(sudo df /boot | awk 'NR==2 {print $1}'))")`

3. Check disk type of boot device. Output of command should return `gpt`.<br/>
    `sudo blkid $bootDevice -o value -s PTTYPE`

4. Validate if `EFI system partition` is available on boot volume. Output of command should return specific partition like `\dev\sda3`.<br/>
    `sudo fdisk -l $bootDevice | grep EFI | awk '{print $1}'`

5. Validate EFI mountpoint is configured. Output of command should return `/boot/efi present in /etc/fstab`<br/>
    `sudo grep -qs '/boot/efi' /etc/fstab && echo '/boot/efi present in /etc/fstab' || echo '/boot/efi missing in /etc/fstab'`

## Upgrade Gen1 VM to Trusted launch

> [!NOTE]
>
> - After you enable Trusted launch, currently VMs can't be rolled back to the Standard security type (non-Trusted launch configuration).
> - vTPM is enabled by default.
> - We recommend that you enable Secure Boot, if you aren't using custom unsigned kernel or drivers. It's not enabled by default. Secure Boot preserves boot integrity and enables foundational security for VMs.

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Make sure that you install the latest [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azps-windows) and are signed in to an Azure account with [Connect-AzAccount](/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount).

Follow the steps to upgrade existing Gen1 VM to Gen2 and enable Trusted launch by using Azure PowerShell.

1. Sign in to the VM Azure subscription.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Connect-AzAccount -SubscriptionId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    ```

2. Deallocate the VM.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myVm
    ```

3. Enable Trusted launch by setting `-SecurityType` to `TrustedLaunch`.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -VMName myVm `
        | Update-AzVM -SecurityType TrustedLaunch `
            -EnableSecureBoot $true -EnableVtpm $true
    ```

4. Validate `securityProfile` in the updated VM configuration.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    # Following command output should be `TrustedLaunch`
    
    (Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -VMName myVm `
        | Select-Object -Property SecurityProfile `
            -ExpandProperty SecurityProfile).SecurityProfile.SecurityType
    
    # Following command output should return `SecureBoot` and `vTPM` settings
    (Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -VMName myVm `
        | Select-Object -Property SecurityProfile `
            -ExpandProperty SecurityProfile).SecurityProfile.Uefisettings
    
    ```

5. Start the VM.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Start-AzVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myVm
    ```

6. Start the upgraded Trusted launch VM. Verify that you can sign in to the VM by using either RDP (for Windows VMs) or SSH (for Linux VMs).

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

Follow the steps to upgrade existing Gen1 VM to Gen2 and enable Trusted launch by using the Azure CLI.

Make sure that you install the latest [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-az-cli2) and are signed in to an Azure account with [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index).

1. Sign in to the VM Azure subscription.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az login
    
    az account set --subscription 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    ```

2. Deallocate the VM.

     ```azurecli-interactive
    az vm deallocate \
        --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVm
    ```

3. Enable Trusted launch by setting `--security-type` to `TrustedLaunch`.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az vm update \
        --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVm \
        --security-type TrustedLaunch \
        --enable-secure-boot true --enable-vtpm true
    ```

4. Validate the output of the previous command. Ensure that the `securityProfile` configuration is returned with the command output.

    ```json
    {
      "securityProfile": {
        "securityType": "TrustedLaunch",
        "uefiSettings": {
          "secureBootEnabled": true,
          "vTpmEnabled": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```

5. Start the VM.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az vm start \
        --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVm
    ```

6. Start the upgraded Trusted launch VM. Verify that you can sign in to the VM by using either RDP (for Windows VMs) or SSH (for Linux VMs).

### [Template](#tab/template)

## Known issues

### Windows 11 boot fails after Trusted launch upgrade of Windows 10 VM

Windows 10 Gen1 VM is successfully upgraded to Trusted launch followed by successful Windows 11 in-place upgrade. However, the Windows 11 boot fails after Azure VM is stopped and started with error shown.

**Resolution**: This issue is fixed with [24H2 build version 26100.2314](/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information#windows-11-current-versions-by-servicing-option).

### [Windows] MBR to GPT conversion fails with error Cannot find room for the EFI system partition

This error occurs for one of following reason:

- There's no free space available on the system volume
- System volume is corrupted. You can validate by trying to Shrink Volume by few MBs under Disk Management console. Use command `chkdsk C:/v/f` to repair system volume.
- `Virtual Disk` service isn't running or unable to communicate successfully. Service startup type should be set to `Manual`.
- `Optimize Drives` service isn't running or unable to communicate successfully. Service startup type should be set to `Manual`.
- System volume disk is already configured with four MBR partitions (maximum supported by MBR disk layout). You need to delete one of the partitions to make room for EFI system partition.
    1. Run `ReAgentc /info` to identify partition actively used by Recovery. Example: `Windows RE location:       \\?\GLOBALROOT\device\harddisk0\partition4\Recovery\WindowsRE`
    2. Run PowerShell cmdlet `Get-Partition -DiskNumber 0` to identify current partitions which are configured.
    3. Run PowerShell cmdlet `Remove-Partition -DiskNumber 0 -PartitionNumber X` to remove any extra Recovery partition not actively used by Recovery service as identified in Step 1.

### [Windows] MBR to GPT failed to update ReAgent.xml

For certain Windows OS versions like Windows 10, MBR2GPT generates pass-through error `MBR2GPT: Failed to update ReAgent.xml, please try to  manually disable and enable WinRE.`

The warning indicates that `MBR2GPT.exe` was unable to update Recovery partition GUID in `C:\Windows\System32\Recovery\ReAgent.xml`. This issue shouldn't cause issue with Guest OS functionality or further upgrade operations like Windows 11 Upgrade to succeed or Windows 11 to work properly post Upgrade.
`ReAgent.xml` is updated with correct GUID post Windows 11 upgrade, that is, if you don’t take any action between MBR2GPT conversion & Windows 11 upgrade, the GUID value in `ReAgent.xml` is synced with Windows recovery configuration.

To manually fix The warning, you can disable and re-enable WinRE post MBR2GPT conversion or post Gen1 to Trusted launch upgrade before Windows 11 upgrade using listed steps, these steps forces sync the WinRE GUID in `ReAgent.xml`

1. Complete Gen1 -> Trusted launch upgrade.
2. Run `reagentc /disable`
3. Run `reagentc /enable`
4. Run `reagentc /info`
5. Open `C:\Windows\System32\Recovery\ReAgent.xml` and validate BCD GUID in xml file is matching the output from Step 4.

### [Windows] D Drive assigned to System Reserved Post upgrade

Temporary storage Drive letter assignment 'D' is changed to 'E' with previous letter assigned to System Reserved post-upgrade of Gen1 VM. Execute below steps manually post-upgrade to work around the issue:

After the upgrade check the disks on the server, if system reserved partition has the letter D, do the following actions:

1. Reconfigure pagefile from D: to C:
2. Reboot the VM
3. Remove letter D: from the partition
4. Reboot the VM to show the temporary storage disk with D: letter

### VM image reference doesn't change post Trusted launch upgrade

Post upgrade of Azure Gen1 VM to Trusted launch, the image reference still reflects source as Gen1 OS image. Image reference not updated is a known limitation and will be addressed with general availability release of Gen1 to Trusted launch VM upgrade support.

## Frequently asked questions

**What if there is Generation 1 VMs, that doesn't fit the prerequisites for Trusted launch?**

For a Generation 1 VM that doesn't meet the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) to upgrade to Trusted launch, look how to fulfill the prerequisites. For example, If using a virtual machine size not supported, look for an [equivalent Trusted launch supported size](trusted-launch.md#virtual-machines-sizes) that supports Trusted launch.

**Why is upgrade to Generation 2 only (without Trusted launch) not supported?**

Trusted launch enables foundational compute security on [Azure Generation 2 VMs](generation-2.md) with no extra cost associated. Also, Trusted launch VMs are majorly on parity with Generation 2 VMs. Hence, there's no added benefit for upgrading only to Generation 2 VM without enabling Trusted launch.
