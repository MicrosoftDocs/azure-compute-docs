> [!NOTE]
> On September 8, 2028, the ability to use Standard HDD disks as [OS disks](../managed-disks-overview.md#os-disk) will be retired. After this date, any remaining Standard HDD OS disks will be automatically converted to Standard SSD of equivalent size if not migrated prior. Standard HDD data disks (non-boot volumes) and [Ephemeral OS disks](../ephemeral-os-disks.md) are not affected. To learn more about the retirement and migration options, see [Migrate your Standard HDD OS disks by September 08, 2028](../disks-hdd-os-retirement.md) and [Convert managed disks storage between different disk types](../disks-convert-types.md).
