# Customer intent: "As an IT administrator using the classic deployment model, I want to migrate my IaaS resources to Azure Resource Manager, so that I can leverage the latest features and avoid any service interruptions before the retirement date."

> [!IMPORTANT]
> VMs created through the classic deployment model will be retired on September 1, 2023.
>
> If you use IaaS resources from Azure Service Management, please complete your migration by September 1, 2023. We encourage you to make the switch sooner to take advantage of the many feature enhancements in Azure Resource Manager.
