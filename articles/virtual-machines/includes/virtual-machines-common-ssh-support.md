## Supported SSH key formats

Azure currently supports following key types:
* SSH protocol 2 (SSH-2) RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) with a minimum length of 2048 bits  
* ED25519 Keys with a fixed length of 256 bits 

Other key formats such as Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) are currently not supported.
