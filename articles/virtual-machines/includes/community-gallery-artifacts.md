# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to assess community images and publisher information, so that I can ensure the reliability and compliance of the virtual machine images that I deploy."

Microsoft doesn't verify or test [community images](../share-gallery-community.md) and associated publisher information. You're solely responsible for any community image that you deploy or use. You're responsible for your dealings with the publishers of images. For approved operating system base images, see the [list in GitHub](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2245050). For other images created by verified publishers, see [Azure Marketplace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2243198).
