# Customer intent: As an IT admin managing disk resources, I want to understand how to change the type of an existing disk to Premium SSD v2, so that I can optimize performance for my cloud storage needs.

> You can change the type of an existing disk to a Premium SSD v2 disk the same way you would for other disk types. To learn about the feature see [Premium SSD v2 migration](#convert-premium-ssd-v2-disks).
