# Customer intent: As a cloud infrastructure planner, I want to identify the regions where ZRS disks are available, so that I can optimize data storage solutions for my applications based on geographic redundancy and compliance requirements.

ZRS disks are  available in all regions that have availability zone support. For a list of these regions, see [Azure regions list](/azure/reliability/regions-list#azure-regions-list-1).
