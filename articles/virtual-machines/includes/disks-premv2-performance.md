# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to understand the IOPS and throughput limits associated with different disk sizes, so that I can accurately plan storage performance for my applications."

|Disk Size  |Maximum available IOPS  |Maximum available throughput (MB/s)  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|1 GiB-64 TiBs    |3,000-80,000 (Increases by 500 IOPS per GiB)        |125-1,200 (increases by 0.25 MB/s per set IOPS)         |
