# Create virtual machines in a scale set using Azure portal

This article steps through using Azure portal to create a Virtual Machine Scale Set.
## Sign in to Azure
Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).


## Create a Virtual Machine Scale Set

You can deploy a scale set with a Windows Server image or Linux image such as RHEL, Ubuntu, or SLES.

1. In the Azure portal search bar, search for and select **Virtual Machine Scale Sets**.
   
2. Select **Create** on the **Virtual Machine Scale Sets** page.
   
3. In the **Basics** tab, under **Project details**, make sure the correct subscription is selected and create a new resource group called *myVMSSResourceGroup*.
   
4. Under **Scale set details**, set *myScaleSet* for your scale set name and select a **Region** that is close to your area.
   
5. Under **Orchestration**, select *Flexible* Orchestration Mode.
    
6. Under **Security type**, select *Trusted launch virtual machines*.
    
7. Under **Scaling**, keep it the Scaling mode as *Manual*.
    
8. Under **Instance count**, set the **initial instance count** field to *5*. You can set this number up to 1000
    
9. Under **Instance details**, select a marketplace image for **Image**. Select any of the Supported Distros.
    
10. Under **Administrator account** configure the admin username and set up an associated password or SSH public key.
      - A **Password** must be at least 12 characters long and meet three out of the four following complexity requirements: one lower case character, one upper case character, one number, and one special character. For more information, see [username and password requirements](../virtual-machines/windows/faq.yml#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm-).
      - If you select a Linux OS disk image, you can instead choose **SSH public key**. You can use an existing key or create a new one. In this example, we will have Azure generate a new key pair for us. For more information on generating key pairs, see [create and use SSH keys](../virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys.md).

11. Select **Next: Spot** to move to the Spot virtual machine configuration options. For this quickstart, leave the default Spot configurations.
    
12. Select **Next: Disks** to move the disk configuration options. For this quickstart, leave the default disk configurations.
    
13. Select **Next: Networking** to move the networking configuration options.

16. When you're done, select **Review + create**.
    
17. After it passes validation, select **Create** to deploy the scale set.


## Clean up resources
When no longer needed, delete the resource group, scale set, and all related resources. To do so, select the resource group for the scale set and then select **Delete**.
