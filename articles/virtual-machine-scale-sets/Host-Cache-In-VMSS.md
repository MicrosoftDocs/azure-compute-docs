# Host Caching In Virtual Machine Scale Sets

**Overview**

In Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), two primary orchestration modes exist: **Uniform VMSS and Flexible VMSS.** Each orchestration mode has distinct behaviors when it comes to managing host caching at both the **VMSS level** and **instance level.** This document outlines the key differences in host caching behaviors between Uniform VMSS and Flexible VMSS, specifically focusing on how changes to host caching can be made for OS and data disks.

**Additional Key Points:**

- **VMSS Behavior is the Same Regardless of Power State:** The behavior of VMSS remains the same whether the scale set is powered on or off. Host caching settings do not change based on the power state of the VMSS.
- **Default Host Caching Settings:**
  - **OS Disk:** By default, VMSS is deployed with the OS disk having the **Read/Write** host cache setting.
  - **Data Disk:** Data disks are, by default, deployed with the **Read-Only** host cache setting.

## Uniform VMSS Behaviour

**VMSS Level Host Caching Configuration**

- **OS and Existing Data Disks:**
  - **No Changes Allowed:** You **cannot change** the host caching for existing OS and data disks at the VMSS level. Once a disk has been deployed in a Uniform VMSS, the host caching setting for that disk is fixed and cannot be modified at the VMSS level.
- **New Data Disks:**
  - **Changes Allowed:** Host caching **can be configured** for new data disks at the VMSS level. However, this setting applies only to newly added data disks and cannot be applied to any disks that are already part of the scale set.

**Instance Level Host Caching configurations**

- **OS Disk:**
  - **No Changes Allowed:** You **cannot change** the host caching for the OS disk at the individual instance level in Uniform VMSS. This setting is locked once the VMSS is created and cannot be modified per instance.
- **Existing Data Disks:**
  - **No Changes Allowed:** As with the OS disk, host caching for existing data disks cannot be changed at the instance level in a Uniform VMSS.
- **New Data Disks:**
  - **No Changes Allowed:** Similarly, host caching cannot be modified for new data disks at the instance level in Uniform VMSS.

## Flexible VMSS Behaviour

**VMSS Level Host Caching Configuration**

- **OS and Existing Data Disks:**
  - **No Changes Allowed:** Similar to Uniform VMSS, **host caching cannot be changed** for existing OS or data disks at the VMSS level. Any changes to host caching settings must be done when adding new disks.
- **New Data Disks:**
  - **Changes Allowed:** Host caching can be set or modified at the VMSS level for newly added data disks, giving more flexibility than Uniform VMSS in terms of VMSS-level host caching adjustments for new disks.

**Instance Level Host Caching Configuration**

- **OS Disk:**
  - **Changes Allowed:** Unlike Uniform VMSS, Flexible VMSS **allows changes** to the host caching setting on the OS disk at the instance level. This gives the ability to customize host caching for specific VM instances.

- **Existing Data Disks:**
  - **Changes Allowed:** Host caching settings can also be modified for **existing data disks** at the instance level. This provides greater flexibility when managing individual VM instances in Flexible VMSS.
- **New Data Disks:**
  - **Changes Allowed:** Host caching can be configured for new data disks at the instance level in Flexible VMSS, allowing for further customizations based on the individual VM instance requirements.

## Conclusion

The key distinction between Uniform VMSS and Flexible VMSS lies in the flexibility offered at the instance level for modifying host caching settings. While both orchestration modes restrict host caching modifications at the VMSS level for OS and existing data disks, Flexible VMSS provides the advantage of making instance-level adjustments to host caching for both OS and data disks, whether they are existing or new. On the other hand, Uniform VMSS is more rigid, offering no flexibility at the instance level to change host caching settings, even for new data disks. Understanding these differences is crucial for optimizing your VMSS architecture based on workload requirements, especially for scenarios that demand specific host caching configurations at the instance level.
